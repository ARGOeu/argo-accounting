title: Assigning Roles to a Client
---

As we have already mentioned, a client can interact with a Project-Provider-Installation relationship only if it has been assigned to it one of the following roles:

- [Project Admin](accounting_system_roles#project-admin)
- [Provider Admin](accounting_system_roles#provider-admin)
- [Installation Admin](accounting_system_roles#installation-admin)

Initially, no client has a role. The Accounting System Administrators can initially turn any client into a Project Admin.

Once you have been assigned the Project Admin role, you can in turn grant roles to other clients.
Generally, any of the above roles can assign roles to other clients at the level of the Project-Provider-Installation relationship they manage.
