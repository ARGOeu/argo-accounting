# Authentication using the Node's OIDC Provider

Before clients can interact with the Accounting System API on behalf of a Node, they must first obtain an access token from that Node’s **OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider**. Each Node has its own OIDC tenant configuration as registered in [Setting up a Node](/docs/guides/setting_up_a_node.md).
