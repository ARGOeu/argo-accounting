Authorization is a process of giving permissions to clients to access the Accounting System API resources. We assign permissions to clients based on their roles. 
A role is a collection of permissions that you can apply to clients. We can assign one or more roles to each client and one or more permissions to each role.

We are going to describe to the next section the available roles that we can grant to each client.
