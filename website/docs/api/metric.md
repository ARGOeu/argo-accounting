# Metric

In order to register a new Metric in the Accounting System, first you have to
complete the following steps:

- Create a new Metric Definition
- Register your Project
- Correlate Providers with the registered Project
- Use a Provider from EOSC-Portal or create a new Provider through AS API
- Create a new Installation

Once you have completed the above steps, you can submit a new metric in the
Accounting System.

The Metric consists of the following attributes:

| Field           | Description                          |
|------------------ |---------------------------------------- |
| id              | Unique ID of the Metric.          |
| [metric_definition_id](./metric_definition.md)|Points to Metric Definition ID.|
| time_period_start | Timestamp of the starting date time (Zulu timestamp). |
| time_period_end       |Timestamp of the end date time (Zulu timestamp).|
| value       | Value of the metric for the given period (decimal value). |

## [POST] - Create a new Metric

You can create a new Metric by executing the following POST request:

```
POST /accounting-system/installations/{installation_id}/metrics

Content-type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {token}

{
"metric_definition_id" : "62973fea0f41a20c683e9014",
"time_period_start": "2020-12-20T09:13:07Z",
"time_period_end": "2020-12-25T11:14:07Z",
"value": 700
}
```

Upon inserting the record into the database, the API returns the Metric
enhanced with the metric id :

Success Response `201 CREATED`

```
{
    "metric_id": "72983kea0h41a20c683e3589",
    "metric_definition_id": "62973fea0f41a20c683e9014",
    "time_period_start": "2020-12-20T09:13:07Z",
    "time_period_end": "2020-12-25T11:14:07Z",
    "value": 700
}
```

## [DELETE] - Delete an existing Metric

The client should be able to delete an existing Metric. As a result, the
Accounting System API has to offer an operation deleting the Metric that
the client wants.
Subsequently, the registered Metric can be deleted by executing the following
request:

```
DELETE /accounting-system/installations/{installation_id}/metrics/{metric_id}

Authorization: Bearer {token}
```

Upon the successful deletion, the API will return the following informative
response:

Success Response `200 OK`

```
{
   "code": 200,
   "message: "The Metric has been deleted successfully."
}
```

## [PATCH] - Update an existing Metric

The following endpoint is used to update the values of an existing Metric:

```
PATCH /accounting-system/installations/{installation_id}/metrics/{id}

Content-type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {token}

{
   "time_period_start": "time_period_start_to_be_updated",
   "time_period_end": "time_period_end_to_be_updated",
   "value": value_to_be_updated
}
```

In order to update the resource properties, the body of the request must
contain an updated representation of Metric. You can update a part or all
attributes of the Metric. The empty or null values are ignored.
The response will be the updated entity :

Success Response `200 OK`

```
{
   "updated_entity"
}
```

## [GET] - Fetch an existing Metric

Having the id of a Metric, the client can request the relevant to that id
Metric by executing the following request:

```
GET /accounting-system/installations/{installation_id}/metrics/{metric_id}

Authorization: Bearer {token}
```

The response is as follows:

Success Response `200 OK`

```
{
"metric_id": "72983kea0h41a20c683e3589",
"metric_definition_id": "62973fea0f41a20c683e9014",
"time_period_start": "2020-12-20T09:13:07Z",
"time_period_end": "2020-12-25T11:14:07Z",
"value": 55
}
```

## [POST] - Search for Metrics

You can search on Metrics, to find the ones corresponding to the given search
criteria. Metrics  can be searched by executing the following request:

```
POST accounting-system/metrics/search
Content-Type: application/json
```

### Example 1

```
{
  "type": "query",
  "field": "time_period_start",
  "values": "2022-01-05T09:13:07Z",
  "operand": "gte"
}
```

### Example 2

```
{
  "type": "filter",
  "operator": "OR",
  "criteria": [
    {
      "type": "query",
      "field": "value",
      "values": 60,
      "operand": lt
    },
    {
      "type": "filter",
      "operator": "AND",
      "criteria": [
        {
          "type": "query",
          "field": "time_period_start",
          "values": "2019-01-05T09:13:07Z",
          "operand": "gte"
        },
        {
          "type": "query",
          "field": "time_period_end",
          "values": "2023-10-05T09:15:07Z",
          "operand": "lt"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

The context of the request should be a JSON object. The syntax of the JSON
object is described [**here**](https://argoeu.github.io/argo-accounting/docs/guides/search-filter).
If the operation is successful, you get a list of metrics, for example:

    "total_elements": 3,
