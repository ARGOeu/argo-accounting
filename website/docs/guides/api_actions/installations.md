# Manage Installations

This is a guide that refers to an Installation. An Installation refers to a
specific instance or part of a resource/service that is allocated to a
specific Project by one Provider. If you are permitted to act on one or more
Installations, this guide outlines all the options available to you.

## Before you start

You can manage an Installation assigned to a specific Project and Provider.

**1.** [Register](/docs/guides/register.md) to Accounting Service.

**2.** [Contact](/docs/authorization/assigning_roles.md) the administrator of
   the Project or the administrator of the
   Project's Provider that this Installation is associated with to assign you
   one or more roles on the Installation.

### NOTE

In the Accounting Service, the **installation_admin** role is the main role
for managing an Installation. This role permits the user to perform any
operation on a specific Installation. If the user is assigned any other role,
they can operate according to the role's permissions.
