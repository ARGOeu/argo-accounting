# Manage Providers

This is a guide that refers to a Provider. A Provider is the Organization that
operates one or more Installations in one or more Projects. If you are
permitted to act on one or more Providers, via this guide you can see all the
options you have.

## Before you start

You can manage a Provider assigned to a specific Project.

**1.** [Register](/docs/guides/register.md) to Accounting Service.  
**2.** [Contact](/docs/authorization/assigning_roles.md) the administrator of
the Project that this Provider is
associated with to assign you one or more roles on the Provider.

**NOTE**  
In the Accounting Service, the **_provider_admin_** role is the main role for
managing a Provider. This role permits the user to perform any operation on a
specific Provider. In case the user is assigned any other role, they can
operate according to the role's permissions.
