# Manage Metrics

This is a guide that refers to Metrics. Metrics are measures of quantitative
assessment, commonly used for assessing, comparing, and tracking usage or
performance of a service. They are the main indicators.

If you are permitted to act on one or more Installations (see [here](https://argoeu.github.io/argo-accounting/docs/api/installation#before-you-start)
), you can also act on the Metrics. Via this guide, you can see all the
options you have.

the Accounting Service API. In order to successfully assign a Metric, you
