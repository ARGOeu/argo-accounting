Not being able to connect to network resources can damage user experiences and can result in users having to use mobile 4G data connections rather than WiFi. Most WiFi monitoring services merely provide information on the Availability (an &quot;Up&quot; or &quot;Down&quot; status) of WiFi and can&#39;t measure the actual performance of the service. A poorly performing WiFi service affects user experiences and can also be a trigger for IT to investigate wider performance issues.

This thematic service aims at integrating multiple-source remote sensing and in-situ data to determine the presence of water in coastal and inland areas. It is applicable to a range of purposes, from the determination of flooded areas (from rainfall, storms, hurricanes, or tsunamis) to the detection of large water leaks in major water distribution networks. It builds on components developed in both national and European projects, integrated to provide a one-stop-shop service for remote sensing information, integrating data from both the Copernicus satellite and drone/unmanned aerial vehicles, validated by existing online in-situ data. The WORSICA service will be available without cost to all European public research groups.

It is a co-designed, interoperable and open source service that integrates biodiversity observations from multiple citizen observatories in one place allowing experts to save time in the species identification process and get access to an enormous number of biodiversity observations.\n\n\nCos4Bio has been developed within the European Horizon 2020 Cos4Cloud project whose main objective is to improve citizen observatories technologies to help them increase the quantity and the quality of observations and, finally, to help ensure their long-term viability.\n\n\nCos4Bio allows citizen science experts to view and identify all observations from a single place, interacting with the community and contributing their knowledge about each species.\n\n\nWhen an observation has been identified in Cos4Bio, this information is updated in the citizen observatory where it was published, awaiting final validation according to the algorithm defined in each observatory, in some cases, these validation algorithms require a Some degree of experience, but in others several identifications of the same observation are required to validate it definitively. The file of each observation can be seen by entering the detail of each one of them.\n\n\n# Main advantages\n\n- Reduce the time that citizen science experts spend on the identification process and therefore on citizens observatories.\n- Allow users to download observations from one portal without forgetting that the platform will recognize and notify each observation’s authorship.\n- Train much better algorithms than if we have separate databases with only the partial information of a single citizen observatory.\n\n#

The European Directory of Ocean-Observing Systems (EDIOS) is the SeaDataNet catalogue promoting discoverability of, and access to, ocean measuring and monitoring systems operated by European countries. EDIOS is an initiative of the European Global Ocean Observing System (EuroGOOS) and helps to maintain visibility of continuously available data sets for operational modelling purposes and supports implementation of the European Unions Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD). EDIOS presents users with three main tiers of information: monitoring i) programmes, ii) platforms and iii) series/stations. The catalogue utilises a metadata format based upon the ISO 19115 content model.

The INFRA-ART Spectral Database is a constantly growing collection of spectra that now contains over 1000 XRF, ATR-FTIR and Raman spectra linked to over 500 known reference materials. The database is an open access resource, freely accessible online, that was developed with the aim to support other specialists within the heritage science field that work with XRF, infrared (ATR-FTIR) or Raman spectroscopic techniques.\n\nThe INFRA-ART Spectral Library follows the European Commission’s recommendation on access to scientific information as well as the FAIR Guiding Principles on research data that result from publicly funded research. This resource supports cross-disciplinary research and reliable re-use of research data for research, innovation, and educational purposes. The INFRA-ART database is targeted to the cultural heritage research community as well as to other specialists in the field of art history, conservation, and materials science.\n\n# Key features\n**» Wide selection of materials**: INFRA-ART covers a wide selection of materials, including materials not represented in other databases, as far as we know, such as an impressive number of earth pigments from different geological sources, special effect pigments (such as metal effect pigments, pearlescent pigments or daylight fluorescent pigments), or traditional Japanese painting materials such as iwa-enogu.\n**» Ongoing compilation of spectra**: New reference samples will be integrated within the database on an ongoing basis as new materials are being analyzed.\n**» Complementary spectral data**: The INFRA-ART database includes data provided by XRF, FTIR and Raman techniques offering thus information at both elemental and molecular level.\n**» Accessible spectroscopic techniques**: The employed techniques (handheld XRF, ATR-FTIR, and fiber-optic Raman) are affordable scientific tools, widely used for the technical examination of works of art, both in-laboratory and on-site applications.\n**» Rich metadata**: Detailed information for each reference material is included (sample source, origin, description, alternative names, chemical information, and history of use) as well as on the employed techniques and data acquisition conditions.\n**» Search engine**: For greater functionality and access, an advanced search engine was incorporated within the INFRA-ART database which allows users to search by keywords, material class or data type.\n**» Spectra viewer**: An interactive spectra-viewer tool was integrated within the webpage in order to allow the user to interact with the loaded spectral data - pick points, label peaks, zoom in and out, pan, and also save the spectrum as image, on local disk.","tagline":"An Open Access Spectral Library of Art-Related Materials as a Digital Support Tool for Cultural Heritage Science","logo":"http://certo.inoe.ro/infraart/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/logo-test.jpg","multimedia":[],"useCases":[],"scientificDomains":[{"scientificDomain":"scientific_domain-natural_sciences","scientificSubdomain":"scientific_subdomain-natural_sciences-physical_sciences"},{"scientificDomain":"scientific_domain-natural_sciences","scientificSubdomain":"scientific_subdomain-natural_sciences-chemical_sciences"},{"scientificDomain":"scientific_domain-humanities","scientificSubdomain":"scientific_subdomain-humanities-other_humanities"}],"categories":[{"category":"category-processing_and_analysis-measurement_and_materials_analysis","subcategory":"subcategory-processing_and_analysis-measurement_and_materials_analysis-analysis"},{"category":"category-sharing_and_discovery-samples","subcategory":"subcategory-sharing_and_discovery-samples-characterisation"},{"category":"category-access_physical_and_eInfrastructures-data_storage","subcategory":"subcategory-access_physical_and_eInfrastructures-data_storage-online"},{"category":"category-sharing_and_discovery-data","subcategory":"subcategory-sharing_and_discovery-data-other"},{"category":"category-sharing_and_discovery-development_resources","subcategory":"subcategory-sharing_and_discovery-development_resources-other"},{"category":"category-processing_and_analysis-data_management","subcategory":"subcategory-processing_and_analysis-data_management-publishing"}],"targetUsers":["target_user-research_communities","target_user-research_groups","target_user-research_organisations","target_user-research_projects","target_user-researchers","target_user-students"],"accessTypes":["access_type-remote"],"accessModes":["access_mode-free"],"tags":["Spectral library","Art materials","Cultural Heritage","Heritage science","Spectroscopy","Open access","FTIR","XRF","Raman","Pigments","Conservation"],"geographicalAvailabilities":["WW"],"languageAvailabilities":["en"],"resourceGeographicLocations":["RO"],"mainContact":null,"publicContacts":[{"firstName":"Ioana Maria","lastName":"Cortea","email":"ioana.cortea@inoe.ro","phone":"+40214575760","position":"Postdoctoral researcher","organisation":"National Institute for Research and Development in Optoelectronics -

On our website, users can create knowledge maps of research topics in any discipline. Knowledge maps provide an immediate overview of a topic, since the most important sub-areas are shown at a glance and linked to relevant resources and concepts. Open Knowledge Maps enables a large number of interest groups to freely access scientific content. Users include researchers, students, librarians, educators, journalists and practitioners around the world. At the same time, we increase the visibility of content from a variety of sources such as repositories, funding organizations, research institutions and publishers. Users can easily and quickly: - Get an overview of a research topic: knowledge maps provide an instant overview of a topic by showing the main areas at a glance, and papers related to each area. This makes it possible to easily identify useful, pertinent information. - Separate the wheat from the chaff: we cluster similar papers together. This makes it easier to identify relevant content when you are searching for an ambiguous term, or when you would like to identify content from a single discipline in a multidisciplinary field. - Identify relevant concepts: one of the most difficult tasks when you are new in a research field is to learn the “language” of the field. Open Knowledge Maps makes it easier for you by labeling research areas with relevant concepts. - Find open content: our knowledge maps include both closed and open access papers. However we highlight open access papers - and the majority of those papers can be read from within the interface. And if not, the fulltext is only a click away. Our BASE integration offers discovery of more than 158 mio research artefacts from more than 7.700 interdisciplinary sources, our PubMed integration offers discovery of more than 30 mio artefacts specialized on biomedical and life science disciplines.","tagline":"A visual interface to the world's scientific knowledge","logo":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/Open_Knowledge_Maps_Logo.jpg/600px-Open_Knowledge_Maps_Logo.jpg","multimedia":[{"multimediaURL":"https://youtu.be/tWw4kJzy7uo","multimediaName":"Multimedia 1"}],"useCases":[],"scientificDomains":[{"scientificDomain":"scientific_domain-generic","scientificSubdomain":"scientific_subdomain-generic-generic"}],"categories":[{"category":"category-processing_and_analysis-data_analysis","subcategory":"subcategory-processing_and_analysis-data_analysis-image_data_analysis"}],"targetUsers":["target_user-researchers","target_user-research_communities","target_user-businesses","target_user-research_projects","target_user-providers"],"accessTypes":["access_type-physical"],"accessModes":["access_mode-paid"],"tags":["Literature Search","Knowledge Discovery","Visual Interface","Natural Language Processing","Document Summarization","e-INFRA (Libraries)"],"geographicalAvailabilities":["WW"],"languageAvailabilities":["en"],"resourceGeographicLocations":[],"mainContact":null,"publicContacts":[{"firstName":null,"lastName":null,"email":"info@openknowledgemaps.org","phone":null,"position":null,"organisation":null}],"helpdeskEmail":"info@openknowledgemaps.org","securityContactEmail":null,"trl":"trl-9","lifeCycleStatus":"life_cycle_status-production","certifications":[],"standards":[],"openSourceTechnologies":[],"version":null,"lastUpdate":null,"changeLog":[],"requiredResources":[],"relatedResources":[],"relatedPlatforms":[],"catalogueId":"eosc","fundingBody":["funding_body-other"],"fundingPrograms":[],"grantProjectNames":[],"helpdeskPage":"https://openknowledgemaps.org/getintouch","userManual":"https://openknowledgemaps.org/faq","termsOfUse":"https://openknowledgemaps.org/imprint#legalnotice","privacyPolicy":"https://openknowledgemaps.org/privacy","accessPolicy":null,"resourceLevel":null,"trainingInformation":"https://openknowledgemaps.org/community#training-materials","statusMonitoring":null,"maintenance":null,"orderType":"order_type-other","order":null,"paymentModel":"https://openknowledgemaps.org/donate-now","pricing":null},{"id":"blue-cloud.rstudio","abbreviation":"rstudio","name":"RStudio","resourceOrganisation":"blue-cloud","resourceProviders":["d4science"],"webpage":"https://blue-cloud.d4science.org/web/blue-cloudlab","description":"An integrated development environment for R.

R and E needs a low-cost, open and transparent alternative VC solution that requires no special software to operate and can be operated and supported from within the community. eduMEET is a WebRTC web-conferencing platform, designed and developed within G&Eacute;ANT project.\n","tagline":"web-based videoconferencing for R&E","logo":"https://edumeet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/eduMEET-01.png","multimedia":[],"useCases":[{"useCaseURL":"https://edumeet.org/why-edumeet/","useCaseName":"Use Case 1"}],"scientificDomains":[{"scientificDomain":"scientific_domain-generic","scientificSubdomain":"scientific_subdomain-generic-generic"}],"categories":[{"category":"category-sharing_and_discovery-applications","subcategory":"subcategory-sharing_and_discovery-applications-collaboration"}],"targetUsers":["target_user-research_communities"],"accessTypes":["access_type-remote"],"accessModes":["access_mode-free"],"tags":["Video-Conferencing","e-INFRA GEANT"],"geographicalAvailabilities":["WW"],"languageAvailabilities":["en"],"resourceGeographicLocations":[],"mainContact":null,"publicContacts":[{"firstName":"EOSC ","lastName":"Enquiries","email":"community@lists.edumeet.org","phone":null,"position":null,"organisation":null}],"helpdeskEmail":"community@lists.edumeet.org","securityContactEmail":null,"trl":"trl-9","lifeCycleStatus":"life_cycle_status-operation","certifications":[],"standards":[],"openSourceTechnologies":[],"version":"1.0","lastUpdate":68936400000000,"changeLog":[],"requiredResources":["geant.edumeet_-_webbased_videoconferencing_platform"],"relatedResources":["geant.ip"],"relatedPlatforms":[],"catalogueId":"eosc","fundingBody":["funding_body-ec"],"fundingPrograms":["funding_program-h2020"],"grantProjectNames":[],"helpdeskPage":null,"userManual":null,"termsOfUse":"https://edumeet.org/build","privacyPolicy":"https://geant.org/privacy-notice/","accessPolicy":null,"resourceLevel":null,"trainingInformation":null,"statusMonitoring":null,"maintenance":null,"orderType":"order_type-fully_open_access","order":"https://edumeet.org/build/","paymentModel":"https://edumeet.org/build/","pricing":"https://edumeet.org/build/"},{"id":"readcoop.transkribus","abbreviation":"Transkribus","name":"Transkribus","resourceOrganisation":"readcoop","resourceProviders":["readcoop"],"webpage":"https://readcoop.eu/transkribus/","description":" Transkribus is a platform for the digitisation, transcription, recognition and searching of historical documents.

It consists of a set of components, amongst them the **Annotator**, a free extension for the Google Chrome browser used by users to create the annotations. \n\n![Pundit in action](https://thepund.it/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/img-hero-smaller.png)\n\nAnnotations can be **highlights** of text parts or **comments**, applied either on a selection of the text or on the whole document. It is also possible to create annotations to **tag** a selected text or an entire web page. This creates a free-form personal category that can be reused in other annotations.\n\nPundit has also some very distinguished features. First of all it supports **semantic annotations**, real RDF triples (subject - predicate -> object) to specify formal, structured and reusable statements associated to the annotated content. Specialized ontologies/vocabularies can be defined, in situations in which a higher precision is needed, e.g. research scenarios in specific domains, identification of concepts in medical reports or even tagging text for machine learning training.\n\nPundit annotations are then collected in “containers” called **Notebooks**. Users can have as many notebooks as they like and can make them “public” or “private”: all annotations contained in them can be, respectively, freely seen or not in their original web pages by using Pundit. Soon Notebooks can also be shared with specific users.\n\nUsers can access the **Pundit WebApp** to see and manage in a centralized place all their annotations done “on the web”. Here they can search and filter annotations with a faceted interface and also export them in a variety of standard/open formats, including Microsoft Office and Open Office files (.xlsx, .docx and .odt) and, for a technical audience, JSON-LD files, fully compliant with the **W3C Web Annotation Data Model** specification.\n\nFor those who don’t want to install the Chrome Extension or prefer to use another web browser, the **FeedThePundit** “proxy service” is available. It allows users to open web pages from every browser, also from mobile devices, with Pundit being automatically activated.\n\nFinally, for developers and system integrators, a set of **APIs** are also publicly available, that allows the development of custom integration scenarios with the Pundit service.\n\nThe tool at present can be **freely used** by everyone as a cloud service managed by Net7. Users can register at https://thepund.it either directly or by using external authentication services, including EGI Check-In.\n\nA part of its codebase is also available as **open source** software with the AGPL 3.0 license.  \n\nPundit is currently **one of the EOSC DIH pilot** (see https://eosc-dih.eu/pundit/ ). The pilot has the following objectives: (1) supporting Net7 to onboard Pundit in the EOSC Marketplace, which will give to this tool a significant boost in visibility, especially amongst European researchers; (2) studying other possible use cases and business exploitation options for Pundit, including the release of the service with a Freemium model (free to use for basic functionalities while for more advanced and professional features the user must pay a recurrent subscription); (3) analysing the technical feasibility for deploying Pundit, which is currently hosted at AWS, in an EOSC infrastructure.","tagline":"A web annotation tool, empowered by semantic technologies, that makes note taking on the web possible and smart","logo":"https://thepund.it/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/logo@2x.png","multimedia":[{"multimediaURL":"https://youtu.be/DmKT4wktPG4","multimediaName":"Introducing the Pundit Annotation Tool (TRIPLE project Open Science Training series)"}],"useCases":[{"useCaseURL":"https://youtu.be/ptxk0waPqPU","useCaseName":"Pundit Use Cases | The Reading List"},{"useCaseURL":"https://youtu.be/tfEqYdgP_JA","useCaseName":"Pundit Use Cases | Studying a correspondence"}],"scientificDomains":[{"scientificDomain":"scientific_domain-generic","scientificSubdomain":"scientific_subdomain-generic-generic"},{"scientificDomain":"scientific_domain-engineering_and_technology","scientificSubdomain":"scientific_subdomain-engineering_and_technology-electrical_electronic_and_information_engineering"},{"scientificDomain":"scientific_domain-social_sciences","scientificSubdomain":"scientific_subdomain-social_sciences-media_and_communications"},{"scientificDomain":"scientific_domain-humanities","scientificSubdomain":"scientific_subdomain-humanities-other_humanities"}],"categories":[{"category":"category-processing_and_analysis-data_management","subcategory":"subcategory-processing_and_analysis-data_management-annotation"},{"category":"category-sharing_and_discovery-applications","subcategory":"subcategory-sharing_and_discovery-applications-productivity"}],"targetUsers":["target_user-research_communities","target_user-research_groups","target_user-researchers","target_user-students"],"accessTypes":["access_type-remote"],"accessModes":["access_mode-free","access_mode-free_conditionally"],"tags":["web-annotation","semantic-web-annotation"],"geographicalAvailabilities":["WW"],"languageAvailabilities":["en"],"resourceGeographicLocations":["IT"],"mainContact":null,"publicContacts":[{"firstName":null,"lastName":null,"email":"pundit@netseven.it","phone":"","position":null,"organisation":null}],"helpdeskEmail":"pundit@netseven.it","securityContactEmail":null,"trl":"trl-9","lifeCycleStatus":"life_cycle_status-operation","certifications":[],"standards":["W3C Web Annotation Data Model"],"openSourceTechnologies":["Angular","Node.js","Laravel","MariaDB","Elasticsearch"],"version":"1.8.3","lastUpdate":1666569600000,"changeLog":[],"requiredResources":[],"relatedResources":[],"relatedPlatforms":[],"catalogueId":"eosc","fundingBody":[],"fundingPrograms":[],"grantProjectNames":[],"helpdeskPage":"https://github.com/net7/pundit-client/issues","userManual":null,"termsOfUse":"https://www.iubenda.com/terms-and-conditions/69930136","privacyPolicy":"https://www.iubenda.com/privacy-policy/69930136/legal","accessPolicy":null,"resourceLevel":null,"trainingInformation":"https://thepund.it/videos-pundit-web-annotation/","statusMonitoring":null,"maintenance":null,"orderType":"order_type-order_required","order":"https://app.thepund.it/register","paymentModel":null,"pricing":null},{"id":"t-systems.open_telekom_cloud","abbreviation":"Open Telekom Cloud","name":"Open Telekom Cloud","resourceOrganisation":"t-systems","resourceProviders":["t-systems"],"webpage":"https://open-telekom-cloud.com/en","description":"Highly scalable public cloud services based on OpenStack, with granular services for compute, storage, connectivity network, security management, databases, data analysis, PaaS and SaaS functions.Enterprise agreements for services with extended support and committed SLAs in silver, gold and platinum options.

The total number of new processor-cores in the cluster is 1696. Each working node contains an additional GP-GPU card (NVIDIA Tesla M2090) with 6 GB of RAM. With a total of 106 NVIDIA Tesla M2090 graphics cards, PARADOX is a premier computer resource in the wider region, which provides access to a large production GPU cluster and new technology. The peak computing power of PARADOX is 105 TFlops.</p>\n<p>One service node (HP DL380p Gen8), equipped with an uplink of 10 Gbps, is dedicated to cluster management and user access (gateway machine). All cluster nodes are interconnected via Infiniband QDR technology, through a non-blocking 144-port Mellanox QDR Infiniband switch. The communication speed of all nodes is 40 Gbps in both directions, which is a qualitative step forward over the previous (Gigabit Ethernet) PARADOX installation. The administration of the cluster is enabled by an independent network connection through the iLO (Integrated Lights-Out) interface integrated on motherboards of all nodes.</p>\n<p>PARADOX cluster is installed in four water-cooled racks.

This daily service generates forecasts of water levels, 2D and 3D velocities, including wave and current interaction, wave parameters and water quality variable over the spatial region of interest for periods of 48 hours, based on numerical simulations of the relevant physical processes. Forcing conditions at the boundaries and over the domain are defined by the user from regional and global forecast databases. Automatic comparison with real-time in-situ sensor data and processed Sentinel images can be provided for a number of user specified locations. It takes advantage of LNEC’s team long-term work on coastal modelling as model developers, integrated in several open source modelling communities (SCHISM, ELCIRC, SELFE, ADCIRC), and in its advanced competences in developing forecast frameworks and operating forecasts deployments. \nUsers and application potential OPENCoastS can contribute directly to the development of new research methodologies and workflows regarding water quality, biological, biochemical and coastal erosion studies. SMEs will benefit from these operational systems to feed their own higher-level service portfolios to respond to other societal needs, without the need to invest time and resources to deploy forecast systems from scratch. Port and coastal authorities –Through the use of this platform coastal managers have all the information required to fulfill their responsibilities (examples of uses include facilitating navigation, reducing port operation costs, reducing emergency planning and response of coastal hazards, and better exploring recreational uses of the coast). ### How to request a service To request use of the OPENCoastS, please fill in thee request form and register at https://opencoasts.ncg.ingrid.pt/. After analysis and validation of the request, you will be allowed to log in and start building your forecasts. Service provided by OPENCoastS is provided by the Portuguese National Civil Engineering Laboratory, and was jointly developed by LNEC and LIP. Currently, the service is deployed at a single computing site (NCG-INGRID-PT, part of [INCD][1] and the [EGI Federation][2]). Through EOSC-hub, OPENCoastS will be expanded to include a more diverse set of geographical data, and improved with integration of new features from the EGI, EUDAT and INDIGO-DataCloud service catalogues.

ODV has been developed largely in the framework of SeaDataNet (the pan-European infrastructure of marine data centers) in which it has become one of the pillars for working with marine in situ data, as well as quality control of the data. One strength of ODV is the flexible and efficient handling of diverse and large data collections often consisting of millions of stations on standard computer hardware. By design, ODV is a stand-alone application that has to be installed on local computers and operates on locally stored datasets. This concept is optimal for cases where datasets are not widely shared and do not change often. Also, because software and data both reside on the end-user’s computer, ODV can be used during expeditions and in remote regions, when internet connections are slow or non-existing. However, the stand-alone configuration is not ideal when users want to work with large community datasets that are updated frequently. The disadvantages are that users have to download the typically large datasets to their local computers and that the local copies of the datasets quickly become outdated because changes in the dataset master copy are not automatically transmitted to the local copy. Users would have to download the modified master dataset again to synchronize with the latest version. Additionally, users are often only interested in specific parts of a large dataset, thus a subsetting service prior to downloading the data would be highly appreciated. \n\nTo address these issues AWI has developed an online version of the ODV software called webODV, and provides typical ODV functionality in form of web services. The idea is to provide clients with user-friendly interfaces in their web-browser and give access to datasets centrally maintained and administered on a server. Obviously, this setup requires internet connection. Users will always work with the latest version of the datasets and will not have to download and store the data on the local computer. This allows analysis and exploration of marine and other environmental data on less capable hardware, such as tablets and smartphones. A first version of WebODV was developed under SeaDataCloud as part of its Virtual Research Environment in the cloud. The version currently deployed on EGI resources (supported by the EGI-ACE project) provides users access to large collections of high quality marine in situ data, on top of which WebODV can be used to direct extract subsets, inspect and visualise the datasets.

Most NOCs will, out of necessity, use a myriad of applications to monitor their infrastructure and services. In turn, they need to contend with manually managing notification profiles and monitoring dashboards in each individual application. Argus mitigates these scenarios by providing the NOC with a&nbsp;singular&nbsp;overview of actionable incidents, and by providing a single point of notification configuration.\n\nArgus is agnostic of the details of each monitoring application, but instead provides a REST API to report new incidents, and to search, fetch or update the status of already registered incidents. Glue services for several source applications already exist, and more can be easily written using the documented API and/or existing API client libraries for Python. Incidents are associated with a source application and can be tagged with arbitrary metadata from the source application, including URLs to drill down into incident details in the source application. Metadata can be used to make arbitrary incident filters, which can be applied both in the dashboard UI and in notification profiles. Mechanisms also exist to add acknowledgements to incidents, and to link incidents with tickets in the NOC&rsquo;s ticketing application. The data model even supports registering inter-relationships between incidents. Notifications via e-mail and SMS are supported, while more mediums are planned (such as Slack and Microsoft Teams).\n\nArgus has been proven useful in providing a distinct interface between individual product teams and the organization&rsquo;s NOC when it comes to defining which monitoring alerts should be handled by the NOC, and which ones the product teams will handle themselves. Argus is open source and is mainly developed by resources from Sikt (Norway), and is currently in production use at Sikt and SUNET (Sweden).\n","tagline":"Alarm Aggregation and Correlation Tool","logo":"https://network.geant.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/no-frame-8.png","multimedia":[],"useCases":[],"scientificDomains":[{"scientificDomain":"scientific_domain-generic","scientificSubdomain":"scientific_subdomain-generic-generic"}],"categories":[{"category":"category-access_physical_and_eInfrastructures-network","subcategory":"subcategory-access_physical_and_eInfrastructures-network-other"}],"targetUsers":["target_user-resource_provider_managers","target_user-research_networks","target_user-research_infrastructure_managers"],"accessTypes":["access_type-remote"],"accessModes":["access_mode-free"],"tags":[],"geographicalAvailabilities":["WW"],"languageAvailabilities":["en"],"resourceGeographicLocations":[],"mainContact":null,"publicContacts":[{"firstName":null,"lastName":null,"email":"argus@lists.geant.org","phone":"","position":null,"organisation":null}],"helpdeskEmail":"argus@lists.geant.org","securityContactEmail":null,"trl":"trl-9","lifeCycleStatus":"life_cycle_status-production","certifications":[],"standards":[],"openSourceTechnologies":[],"version":"1.0","lastUpdate":1667520000000,"changeLog":[],"requiredResources":[],"relatedResources":[],"relatedPlatforms":[],"catalogueId":"eosc","fundingBody":["funding_body-ec"],"fundingPrograms":["funding_program-h2020"],"grantProjectNames":[],"helpdeskPage":null,"userManual":"https://wiki.geant.org/display/netdev/Argus","termsOfUse":"https://wiki.geant.org/display/netdev/Argus","privacyPolicy":"https://wiki.geant.org/display/netdev/Argus","accessPolicy":null,"resourceLevel":null,"trainingInformation":"https://wiki.geant.org/display/netdev/Argus","statusMonitoring":null,"maintenance":null,"orderType":"order_type-fully_open_access","order":"https://wiki.geant.org/display/netdev/Argus","paymentModel":null,"pricing":"https://wiki.geant.org/display/netdev/Argus"},{"id":"forschungsdaten.forschungsdateninfo","abbreviation":"fd.info","name":"forschungsdaten.info","resourceOrganisation":"forschungsdaten","resourceProviders":["forschungsdaten","kit-lib","uni_konstanz"],"webpage":"https://www.forschungsdaten.info/","description":"Forschungsdaten.info is the German-language information portal on research data management (RDM).

A dedicated, secure, private, virtual data centre hosted within our OpenStack infrastructure; 2. An allocation of CPU, RAM and storage resources for you to manage according to your project’s needs; 3. Internal and external network configuration of your space, specified by you, with simple firewall and VPN functions; 4. You take on full programmatic control and integration of your space; 5. Your host organisation is solely in charge of the systems administration within your Embassy Cloud space; 6. In addition to the public data sets, you can request access to specified internal EMBL-EBI data resources such as filesets or databases (e.g. ChEMBL, Ensembl, 1000 Genomes Project archive, Uniprot).

This collaborative project was established to fulfill the objectives of the [1998 Washington Conference Principles on Nazi-Confiscated Art](https://www.state.gov/p/eur/rt/hlcst/122038.htm), the [2000 Vilnius Forum Declaration](https://www.lootedart.com/MFV7EE39608) and the [2009 Terezin Declaration](https://www.state.gov/p/eur/rls/or/126162.htm), particularly to make all such records publicly accessible.\n\nThe Portal links researchers to archival materials consisting of descriptions of records and, in many cases, digital images of the records that relate to cultural property that was stolen, looted, seized, forcibly sold, or otherwise lost during the Nazi era. These records, which are in many different languages, include Nazi documentation, governmental records from 1933 onwards, inventories of recovered artworks, post-war claims records and auction house and art dealer records. Cultural property documented in these records covers a broad range from artworks to books and libraries, religious objects, antiquities, archival documents, carvings, silver and more.\n\nAll descriptions within the Portal are provided in English.

We are the co-founder and the main organiser of Focus on Open Science series, together with UCL and LIBER Europe.

We value creativity and we employ such inventiveness to move away from videotelephony formats (e.g. Zoom, MS Teams, etc). Our response to the digital fatigue and the low turn up rates - which became a norm for many post-COVID19 online events- is to create live and recorded video productions and to increase the skills of contributors, such as science communication and public speaking. We are part of a number of scientific committees for conferences and workshops and we are often invited to contribute to the academic programme of such events.

Using the cloud allows you to set up a world-class IT infrastructure without the extensive capital costs associated with procuring IT hardware. The cloud also offers the ability to scale your IT infrastructure at a moment’s notice to keep up with the demands of your business. By using a cloud platform, you can quickly provision new servers and shut them down when they are not required any more without wasting resources on underused infrastructure. You can also benefit from reclaiming lost office space and reducing the costs of power and cooling which are necessary for power-hungry servers. By using 100 Percent IT’s cloud solution, your data will be stored securely in one of our three UK-based datacentres. These datacentres are all high-end datacentres, boasting multiple redundant power supplies and internet connections, backup generators and UPS systems and 24/7 security. All of our IT infrastructure is resilient and redundant, giving you confidence that your IT infrastructure won’t fail you at a critical moment. ### Features: 1. Fully Scalable 2. Self-service Cloud Platform 3. Optional Hourly Billing (only pay for what you use) 4. Advanced Software Defined Networking, including: 1. Routers 2. Load Balancers 3. Virtual Routers 4. Firewalls 5. VPN’s 5. Tier3 Datacentres, with multiple redundancy on all critical infrastructure 6. Cloud servers can be integrated into your office network (Hybrid Cloud) 7. World class connectivity Users of the service can also benefit from 100 Percent IT’s cutting edge patented cybersecurity solution, ‘Trusted Cloud’. The technology employed is a cutting edge approach called distributed hardware-backed whitelisting. Every few seconds, each server in our estate will generate an audit list of all programs and configuration running on the server. This list is digitally signed using a cryptographically secure hardware module and then sent to one or more verification servers where it will be cross-checked against a previously generated and signed whitelist. Even a single line of unauthorised code will be instantly detected and flagged, allowing CyberHive’s security team to stop an attack in its tracks before any damage can be inflicted or data lost. 100 Percent IT cloud services offer reliability, scalability and value for money at the same time as providing a reliable and trusted platform for hosting critical data and services. Using IaaS can dramatically reduce the cost and pain associated with maintaining traditional on-premise servers. Trusted Cloud is a new cutting edge cybersecurity solution that protects critical infrastructure and sensitive data by identifying in seconds any unauthorised code or configuration running on the servers. 100 Percent IT is supplying IaaS for the NextGEOSS service ( https://nextgeoss.eu/ ) through the EGI as well as services to a number of academic and commercial customers.","tagline":"Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), secured by cutting edge cybersecurity software co-developed by the University of

It provides easy, transparent end-to-end monitoring, giving access to network measurement data from multiple network domains. It can operate at local level or around the globe and is scalable to provide at-a-glance information about multiple network paths simultaneously. By tracking performance across and between domains it is now possible to identify and rectify any potential performance bottlenecks, helping research teams focus their efforts on their research and allowing NRENs to identify where investments in new capacity will provide the best return. With more than 1, 400 measurement points​ across the globe, it is now far easier for NRENs and research teams to accurately measure network performance and ensure it meets their research needs.​ The development of perfSONAR is the result of the combined work of GEANT, Internet2, ESnet and Indiana University.

The installation and the configuration of the cluster are performed by means of the execution of Ansible receipts. The cluster configured by EC3 is private: as soon as it is configured the user will have root access to the environment, and can setup and configure the cluster installing additional libraries and software to their needs. ### Features: - Federated authentication through the EGI Applications on Demand service. - Web based access. - Interoperability with most widely used IaaS cloud technologies - Wizard interface to streamline the configuration and the deployment of the virtual cluster on top of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) providers. - Several Ansible receipts are available to deploy applications and tools in the cluster nodes. - Nodes of the clusters will be self-managed by CLUES. Working nodes will be undeployed when they are idle. - Use of ‘per-user subproxies’ from EGI to access X.509-protected resources on the users’ behalf. - Access to the HNSciCloud commercial cloud service providers for limited scale usage, via a voucher of €250, 00 euros. - User support is available by an international network of consultants.

develops and uses highly sophisticated computer programs to investigate, characterize, and predict materials at the atomic level. It thus provides insight into materials properties and functions and the design and development of new materials that meet specific requirements. Providing a forefront infrastructure for computed materials data, that enables the exploitation of this significant raw material, is the aim of the Novel Materials Discovery (NOMAD) project. The NOMAD Repository accepts, more precisely requests, input and output files of all important codes. The NOMAD Repository keeps data for at least 10 years. Open access can be delayed by up to three years. DOIs are provided on request to make the data citable. See also https://youtu.be/UcnHGokl2Nc. The NOMAD Repository is the world’s largest collection of computational materials science data, hosting raw data contributed by the community of electronic-structure theory. The NOMAD Repository is not restricted to a single code or a closed group of researchers.

The resulting analysis can be used to index and search documents by lemmas instead of multiple word forms, extract syntactic dependencies with POS information to get relations between words or lemmas, or get grammatical information for every word in the text. While in many cases the results can be used directly (statistical analysis on part of speech, lemmas and words), in many other applications the results of UDPipe serve as intermediate input to more sophisticated analysis, such as infomration extraction, knowledge representation, term extraction etc. UDPipe software allow to train on any language for which a treebank is available in the CoNLL-U

10^12 secondary particles denominated Extensive Air Showers (EAS). A huge amount of computational resources are needed to simulate and analyse the complete development of the cascades. For doing this we developed LAGO-ARTI, an own designed framework including different simulations tools and own codes to determine in a very precise way, the signals expected at any detector of any type, in any particular site around the World, and under realistic atmospheric and geomagnetic time-evolving conditions. \n\nLAGO, the Latin American Giant Observatory, is an extended cosmic ray observatory, consisting of a wide network of water Cherenkov detectors located in 10 countries. With different altitudes and geomagnetic rigidity cutoffs, their geographic distribution, combined with the new electronics for control, atmospheric sensing and data acquisition, allows the realization of diverse astrophysics studies at a regional scale. LAGO is mainly oriented to perform basic research focusing on three main areas: high energy phenomena, the measurement of atmospheric radiation at ground level and space weather and climate monitoring.","tagline":"A tool to simulate the radiation expected by the interaction of Astroparticles with the atmosphere at any place in the World: an implementation of LAGO ARTI for EOSC.","logo":"http://lagoproject.net/images/lago-logo-90.png","multimedia":[{"multimediaURL":"https://youtu.be/LjP-fxv5_rQ","multimediaName":"Multimedia 1"}],"useCases":[{"useCaseURL":"http://lagoproject.net/solar.html","useCaseName":"Use Case 1"},{"useCaseURL":"http://lagoproject.net/grb.html","useCaseName":"Use Case 2"}],"scientificDomains":[{"scientificDomain":"scientific_domain-natural_sciences","scientificSubdomain":"scientific_subdomain-natural_sciences-physical_sciences"}],"categories":[{"category":"category-sharing_and_discovery-applications","subcategory":"subcategory-sharing_and_discovery-applications-utilities"},{"category":"category-sharing_and_discovery-data","subcategory":"subcategory-sharing_and_discovery-data-scientific_research_data"},{"category":"category-sharing_and_discovery-software","subcategory":"subcategory-sharing_and_discovery-software-software_package"}],"targetUsers":["target_user-researchers","target_user-research_groups","target_user-research_communities","target_user-research_projects","target_user-students"],"accessTypes":["access_type-virtual"],"accessModes":["access_mode-free"],"tags":["High-energy-astrophysics","Particle-astrophysics","Cosmic-rays","Galactic-cosmic-rays","Cosmic-ray-showers","Gamma-rays","Gamma-ray-sources","Gamma-ray-bursts","Gamma-ray-transient-sources","Solar-system-astronomy","Space-weather","Space-climate","Solar-terrestrial-interactions","Astronomical-methods","Computational-astronomy","Cloud-computing","Astronomy-software","Astronomical-simulations","Astroparticle-simulations","Cosmic-Rays-Showers","Extensive-Air-Showers","Extensive-Air-Shower-simulations","CORSIKA","Background-radiation","EAS","EAS-simulations","GRB","Geomagnetic-Field-Effect","Rigidity-cutoff","LAGO"],"geographicalAvailabilities":["WW"],"languageAvailabilities":["en"],"resourceGeographicLocations":["ES","PL","PT"],"mainContact":null,"publicContacts":[{"firstName":null,"lastName":"The LAGO EOSC Team","email":"lago-eosc@lagoproject.net","phone":"","position":null,"organisation":"lago"}],"helpdeskEmail":"lago-eosc@lagoproject.net","securityContactEmail":null,"trl":"trl-7","lifeCycleStatus":"life_cycle_status-beta","certifications":[],"standards":["FAIR"],"openSourceTechnologies":[],"version":null,"lastUpdate":null,"changeLog":[],"requiredResources":["egi-fed.check-in","egi-fed.egi_datahub","geant.eduteams","grycap.elastic_cloud_compute_cluster","grycap.infrastructure_manager","eudat.b2find","eudat.b2handle"],"relatedResources":[],"relatedPlatforms":[],"catalogueId":"eosc","fundingBody":["funding_body-ec"],"fundingPrograms":["funding_program-h2020"],"grantProjectNames":["European Open Science Cloud-Expanding Capacities by building Capabilities (EOSC-SYNERGY) project, Grant Agreement nº 857647"],"helpdeskPage":null,"userManual":"https://moodle.learn.eosc-synergy.eu/course/view.php?id=16","termsOfUse":"https://lagoproject.net/lagoCommonRights/","privacyPolicy":"https://lagoproject.net/lagoCommonRights/","accessPolicy":"https://lagoproject.net/lagoCommonRights/","resourceLevel":null,"trainingInformation":"https://moodle.learn.eosc-synergy.eu/course/view.php?id=16","statusMonitoring":null,"maintenance":null,"orderType":"order_type-order_required","order":"https://lagoproject.github.io/DMP/docs/howtos/how_to_join_LAGO_VO/","paymentModel":null,"pricing":null},{"id":"geant.ocreorangebusiness","abbreviation":"OCREOrangeBusiness","name":"OCRE Cloud Services by Orange Business Services","resourceOrganisation":"geant","resourceProviders":["geant"],"webpage":"https://clouds.geant.org/ocre/orange/","description":"As part of the Open Cloud for Research Environments (OCRE) framework,&nbsp;Orange Business Services&nbsp;is proud to provide its global public cloud platform:&nbsp;Flexible Engine.\n\nAs leading European IT integrator and telecom operator, we are convinced that reasearch and innovation are key to helping organisations thrive.

In particular, the environment is powered by RStudio®, an open source development environment including a code editor, and debugging and visualization tools. Moreover, this VRE is powered by the gCube data analytics platform and allows to perform the following tasks: Integrate R algorithms into the platform; Execute integrated algorithms by benefitting from a distributed computing infrastructure Automatically generate research objects out of any computation In addition to the basic functionalities, as a workspace for sharing objects of interest, a social networking area for supporting the discussions among members and a user management facility for managing membership, this VLab is specifically equipped with the following capabilities: - Geospatial Data View: a facility enabling users to discover and visualize GIS layers, e.g. species distribution maps that have been generated and published. This facility relies on the GeoExplorer portlet and makes it possible to effectively exploit the generated maps and perform comparisons and analysis of the diverse distributions by enabling maps overlay, transects production and values inspection; - Data Analytics at Scale: a facility enabling users to benefit from the offering of the DataMiner service and interactively execute a large array of data analytics tasks on datasets.

The Common Data Index service (CDI) gives users, via an ISO19115 - ISO19139 based index (metadatabase), a highly detailed insight in the availability and geographical spreading of marine data from the different data centres across Europe.

Enable intelligent and contextualized research discovery.Connect public to open access research in Europe and beyond.9, 200 registered users. 50, 000 users use the service on the average every month.","tagline":"Find open linked research","logo":"https://www.openaire.eu/images/service_images/Search--Share.png","multimedia":[],"useCases":[],"scientificDomains":[{"scientificDomain":"scientific_domain-generic","scientificSubdomain":"scientific_subdomain-generic-generic"}],"categories":[{"category":"category-aggregators_and_integrators-aggregators_and_integrators","subcategory":"subcategory-aggregators_and_integrators-aggregators_and_integrators-data"}],"targetUsers":["target_user-providers","target_user-research_projects","target_user-research_organisations","target_user-research_groups"],"accessTypes":["access_type-virtual"],"accessModes":[],"tags":["Portal","e-INFRA OpenAIRE"],"geographicalAvailabilities":["WW"],"languageAvailabilities":["en"],"resourceGeographicLocations":[],"mainContact":null,"publicContacts":[{"firstName":null,"lastName":null,"email":"info@openaire.eu","phone":"","position":null,"organisation":null}],"helpdeskEmail":"kiatrop@di.uoa.gr","securityContactEmail":null,"trl":"trl-9","lifeCycleStatus":"life_cycle_status-production","certifications":[],"standards":[],"openSourceTechnologies":[],"version":"v3","lastUpdate":1517356800000,"changeLog":[],"requiredResources":[],"relatedResources":["geant.edugain"],"relatedPlatforms":[],"catalogueId":"eosc","fundingBody":["funding_body-ec"],"fundingPrograms":[],"grantProjectNames":[],"helpdeskPage":"https://www.openaire.eu/helpdesk","userManual":"https://www.openaire.eu/claim-publication","termsOfUse":"https://catalogue.openaire.eu/files/ToS%20OpenAIRE%2011_04_22.pdf","privacyPolicy":"https://catalogue.openaire.eu/files/Personal%20Data%20Protection%20Policy%20for%20OpenAIRE%20Services%20April%202022.pdf","accessPolicy":"https://catalogue.openaire.eu/files/Personal%20Data%20Protection%20Policy%20for%20OpenAIRE%20Services%20April%202022.pdf","resourceLevel":null,"trainingInformation":null,"statusMonitoring":null,"maintenance":null,"orderType":"order_type-open_access","order":"https://catalogue.openaire.eu/service/openaire.discovery_portal/pricing","paymentModel":null,"pricing":null},{"id":"eudat.b2handle","abbreviation":"B2HANDLE","name":"B2HANDLE","resourceOrganisation":"eudat","resourceProviders":["grnet","surf-nl","gwdg"],"webpage":"https://www.eudat.eu/services/b2handle","description":"B2HANDLE is the distributed service for storing, managing and accessing persistent identifiers (PIDs) and essential metadata (PID records) as well as managing PID namespaces. The implementation of the service relies on the DONA/Handle persistent identifier solution. B2HANDLE can be used by middleware applications, end-user tools and other service to reliably identify data objects over longer timespans and through changes in object location or ownership. The B2HANDLE service encompasses management of identifier namespaces (Handle prefixes), establishment of policies and business workflows, operation of Handle servers and technical services, and a user-friendly Python library for general interaction with Handle servers and EUDAT-specific extensions. B2HANDLE is mostly transparent to end-users, shielding them from the complexity of infrastructure details. B2HANDLE supports a dedicated Handle record structure (a PID profile) for the safe data management within an infrastructure with a given topology.\n\n**Features**\n\n- Globally resolvable identifiers via the Global Handle Network (DONA, https://hdl.handle.net/)\n- Communities and organisations can obtain Handle Prefixes (ePIC, 21.######) for their own use\n- PIDs can be hosted at EUDAT service providers\n- B2HANDLE operates as a federation of EUDAT service providers based on policies\n- PIDs are mirrored across multiple providers for high resolution and high availability\n- Handle records can be customised to community and organisational needs (for example include checksums and timestamps to ensure authenticity of the data objects)\n- Support for reverse look-ups of Handle records\n- REST API for easy registration and minting of PIDs","tagline":"Register your research data with a persistent identifier","logo":"https://www.eudat.eu/sites/default/files/b2henlde.png","multimedia":[{"multimediaURL":"https://www.slideshare.net/EUDAT/introduction-to-persistent-identifiers","multimediaName":"Multimedia 1"},{"multimediaURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDh1DbBfZcc","multimediaName":"Multimedia 2"}],"useCases":[],"scientificDomains":[{"scientificDomain":"scientific_domain-generic","scientificSubdomain":"scientific_subdomain-generic-generic"}],"categories":[{"category":"category-processing_and_analysis-data_management","subcategory":"subcategory-processing_and_analysis-data_management-persistent_identifier"},{"category":"category-sharing_and_discovery-scholarly_communication","subcategory":"subcategory-sharing_and_discovery-scholarly_communication-publication"}],"targetUsers":["target_user-research_groups","target_user-research_managers","target_user-research_projects","target_user-providers","target_user-research_infrastructure_managers","target_user-research_organisations","target_user-research_communities","target_user-researchers"],"accessTypes":["access_type-virtual"],"accessModes":["access_mode-paid"],"tags":["persistent identifier","Handle","e-INFRA EUDAT"],"geographicalAvailabilities":["EU"],"languageAvailabilities":["en"],"resourceGeographicLocations":["EO"],"mainContact":null,"publicContacts":[{"firstName":"EUDAT","lastName":"Secretariat","email":"helpdesk@eudat.eu","phone":null,"position":null,"organisation":"eudat"}],"helpdeskEmail":"helpdesk@eudat.eu","securityContactEmail":null,"trl":"trl-9","lifeCycleStatus":"life_cycle_status-production","certifications":[],"standards":[],"openSourceTechnologies":["Handle (http://handle.net/)"],"version":"1.2","lastUpdate":1529625600000,"changeLog":[],"requiredResources":[],"relatedResources":[],"relatedPlatforms":["related_platform-eudatcdi","related_platform-dice"],"catalogueId":"eosc","fundingBody":["funding_body-ec"],"fundingPrograms":["funding_program-h2020"],"grantProjectNames":["DICE (101017207)"],"helpdeskPage":"http://eudat.eu/support-request?Service=B2HANDLE","userManual":"https://eudat.eu/services/userdoc/b2handle","termsOfUse":"https://www.eudat.eu/eudat-cdi-aup","privacyPolicy":"https://wiki.eoscfuture.eu/display/PUBLIC/About+ToU+and+PP","accessPolicy":null,"resourceLevel":null,"trainingInformation":"https://eudat.eu/how-to-manage-persistent-identifiers-b2handle","statusMonitoring":"https://avail.eudat.eu/eudat/dashboard/Critical/B2HANDLE%20CDI","maintenance":null,"orderType":"order_type-order_required","order":"https://eudat.eu/support-request?service=B2HANDLE","paymentModel":null,"pricing":"https://www.eudat.eu/services/userdoc/b2handle#B2HANDLE-HowcanIuseB2HANDLE?"},{"id":"emso_eric.eosc_future_environment_dashboard","abbreviation":"EOSC Future Environment Dashboard","name":"EOSC Future Dashboard for Environmental Indicators","resourceOrganisation":"emso_eric","resourceProviders":[],"webpage":"https://env-dashboard.eoscfuture.eu/","description":"Each of the Research Infrastructures working in the ENVRI FAIR Science Cluster gathers and manages a wealth of environmental data and model results.

This will make sure policy, science, industry, and the public will be able to rely on these environmental data.\n\nKeeping a close watch on environmental boundary conditions and informing society stakeholders of their short- and long-term developments is not only important for the environment but also crucial to the economy. That is why this project will develop a ‘dashboard’ with a set of easily understandable real-time indicators to inform both the broader public and policymakers on the state of the environment. The dashboard will be mounted as a front-end of the ENVRI-Hub, a virtual common platform for ENVRI-FAIR data and services that will be integrated into the EOSC platform.

Even a single line of unauthorised code will be instantly detected and flagged, allowing CyberHive’s security team to stop an attack in its tracks before any damage can be inflicted or data lost. 100 Percent IT cloud services offer reliability, scalability and value for money at the same time as providing a reliable and trusted platform for hosting critical data and services. Using IaaS can dramatically reduce the cost and pain associated with maintaining traditional on-Premise servers. Trusted Cloud is a new cutting edge cybersecurity solution that protects critical infrastructure and sensitive data by identifying in seconds any unauthorised code or configuration running on the servers. 100 Percent IT is supplying IaaS for the NextGEOSS service ( https://nextgeoss.eu/ ) through the EGI as well as services to a number of academic and commercial customers.","count":1},{"value":"An integrated development environment for R.

Most NOCs will, out of necessity, use a myriad of applications to monitor their infrastructure and services. In turn, they need to contend with manually managing notification profiles and monitoring dashboards in each individual application. Argus mitigates these scenarios by providing the NOC with a&amp;nbsp;singular&amp;nbsp;overview of actionable incidents, and by providing a single point of notification configuration.\n\nArgus is agnostic of the details of each monitoring application, but instead provides a REST API to report new incidents, and to search, fetch or update the status of already registered incidents. Glue services for several source applications already exist, and more can be easily written using the documented API and/or existing API client libraries for Python. Incidents are associated with a source application and can be tagged with arbitrary metadata from the source application, including URLs to drill down into incident details in the source application. Metadata can be used to make arbitrary incident filters, which can be applied both in the dashboard UI and in notification profiles. Mechanisms also exist to add acknowledgements to incidents, and to link incidents with tickets in the NOC&amp;rsquo;s ticketing application. The data model even supports registering inter-relationships between incidents. Notifications via e-mail and SMS are supported, while more mediums are planned (such as Slack and Microsoft Teams).\n\nArgus has been proven useful in providing a distinct interface between individual product teams and the organization&amp;rsquo;s NOC when it comes to defining which monitoring alerts should be handled by the NOC, and which ones the product teams will handle themselves.

ODV has been developed largely in the framework of SeaDataNet (the pan-European infrastructure of marine data centers) in which it has become one of the pillars for working with marine in situ data, as well as quality control of the data. One strength of ODV is the flexible and efficient handling of diverse and large data collections often consisting of millions of stations on standard computer hardware. By design, ODV is a stand-alone application that has to be installed on local computers and operates on locally stored datasets. This concept is optimal for cases where datasets are not widely shared and do not change often. Also, because software and data both reside on the end-user’s computer, ODV can be used during expeditions and in remote regions, when internet connections are slow or non-existing. However, the stand-alone configuration is not ideal when users want to work with large community datasets that are updated frequently. The disadvantages are that users have to download the typically large datasets to their local computers and that the local copies of the datasets quickly become outdated because changes in the dataset master copy are not automatically transmitted to the local copy.

On our website, users can create knowledge maps of research topics in any discipline. Knowledge maps provide an immediate overview of a topic, since the most important sub-areas are shown at a glance and linked to relevant resources and concepts. Open Knowledge Maps enables a large number of interest groups to freely access scientific content. Users include researchers, students, librarians, educators, journalists and practitioners around the world. At the same time, we increase the visibility of content from a variety of sources such as repositories, funding organizations, research institutions and publishers. Users can easily and quickly: - Get an overview of a research topic: knowledge maps provide an instant overview of a topic by showing the main areas at a glance, and papers related to each area. This makes it possible to easily identify useful, pertinent information. - Separate the wheat from the chaff: we cluster similar papers together. This makes it easier to identify relevant content when you are searching for an ambiguous term, or when you would like to identify content from a single discipline in a multidisciplinary field. - Identify relevant concepts: one of the most difficult tasks when you are new in a research field is to learn the “language” of the field. Open Knowledge Maps makes it easier for you by labeling research areas with relevant concepts. - Find open content: our knowledge maps include both closed and open access papers. However we highlight open access papers - and the majority of those papers can be read from within the interface. And if not, the fulltext is only a click away. Our BASE integration offers discovery of more than 158 mio research artefacts from more than 7.700 interdisciplinary sources, our PubMed integration offers discovery of more than 30 mio artefacts specialized on biomedical and life science disciplines.","label":"Open Knowledge Maps is the world's largest visual search engine for research.

The score can optionally be enhanced by a Laplace pre-Filter and/or a core-Weighted version to minimize overlapping densities from neighboring subunits. This is now operating under EOSC-Hub.
