It is part of the national ESFRI roadmap, which is in turn aligned with the European Union’s ESFRI framework. Indeed, Huma-Num is entrusted with France’s participation in two European Research Infrastructure Consortia (ERIC): DARIAH (Digital Research Infrastructure for the Arts and Humanities) and CLARIN (Common Language Resources and Technologies Infrastructure). It is also involved in European and international projects. Huma-Num aims at supporting research communities by providing services, assessment and tools on digital research data. To perform its missions, the TGIR Huma-Num bases its activities on a innovative form of organization that combines human (collective consultation through Huma-Num’s consortia, which are groups of researchers and engineers, funded by Huma-Num, working on common areas of interest) and technological resources (sustainable digital services) on a national and European scale. With the consortia it supervises, Huma-Num coordinates the production of digital data while offering a variety of platforms and tools for the processing, conservation, dissemination and long-term preservation of digital research data. One of the scientific objective of such involvement is to promote data sharing so that other researchers, communities or disciplines, can reuse them, including from an interdisciplinary perspective and in different ways. More generally, the principles and methods of the Web of data (RDF, SPARQL, SKOS, OWL) on which Huma-Num’s services rely enable data to be documented or re-documented for various uses without confining them to inaccessible silos. As a consequence, Huma-Num encourages core principles and methods such as open science and the technologies of Web of data to promote interoperability as much internally to allow its services to communicate with one another, as externally to let users plug their tools into Huma-Num services.

The Consorzio Interuniversitario Risonanze Magnetiche di Metallo Proteine (CIRMMP) was founded in 1994 among the Universities of Florence, Siena and Bologna to develop and coordinate resources in the study of metalloproteins. CIRMMP manages and partially owns the instruments in CERM, one of the most well-equipped NMR laboratories in the world. CERM/CIRMMP hosts a number of laboratories, offices and common rooms over an area of 3,000 square meters. The flagship of the Center is the impressive collection of NMR spectrometers which feature the largest magnetic field range in the world (from 1.2 GHz to the earth field) and ranks it among the best equipped laboratories in the world. CERM/CIRMMP is located in the Scientific Campus (“Polo Scientifico”) of the University of Florence in Sesto Fiorentino, an area just west of the city of Florence. The campus borders Florence International Airport and yet is a mere 15 minutes from the centre of Florence, world-renowned cradle of renaissance art and culture. Its two-fold status as a public-private laboratory fosters interactions between private industry and public research institutions such as Universities, National Council of Research (CNR) Institutes and European counterparts, promoting synergistic activities such as collaborations and services to SMEs. CERM/CIRMMP is the Italian Instruct-ERIC Centre. Instruct-ERIC is the pan-European research infrastructure in structural biology, making high-end technologies and methods available to users. Instruct-ERIC became operational in 2012 and has grown through its R&D Pilot programme, to provide new services and training courses to support scientists.

All of the INFN’s research activities are undertaken within a framework of international competition, in close collaboration with Italian universities on the basis of solid academic partnerships spanning decades. Fundamental research in these areas requires the use of cutting-edge technology and instruments, developed by the INFN at its own laboratories and in collaboration with industries. Groups from the Universities of Rome, Padua, Turin, and Milan founded the INFN on 8thAugust 1951 to uphold and develop the scientific tradition established during the 1930s by Enrico Fermi and his school, with their theoretical and experimental research in nuclear physics. In the latter half of the 1950s the INFN designed and built the first Italian accelerator, the electron synchrotron developed in Frascati, where its first national laboratory was set up. During the same period, the INFN began to participate in research into the construction and use of ever-more powerful accelerators being conducted by CERN, the European Organisation for Nuclear Research, in Geneva.

The research conducted here into the fundamental mechanisms of nature is of immense value to the scientific, educational, cultural, and the overall socioeconomic development of Serbia.</p>\n<p>Founded in 1961, the Institute of Physics was a product of a surge in physics research in postwar Yugoslavia. The initiative for its founding came from Aleksandar Milojević, a renowned university professor, based on the need, at the time increasingly evident, to unify all non-nuclear physics research endeavors into a single institution. The Institute of Physics was born.</p>\n<p>Committed to continuous reexamination, and to kinship, governed by an openness to new ideas and personal betterment, it went through perilous times, but also years of growth and moments of startling discovery. By developing a network of allies and collaborators, the Institute of Physics has launched, strengthened and supported numerous laudable initiatives in Serbia and the wider region.</p>\n<p>In the current research cycle, the Institute of Physics is the principal partner in 12 fundamental research projects, three interdisciplinary and one project of technological development, while its researchers also participate in 16 national research projects. Since 2013, the Institute has seen as many as 103 international projects and collaborations, of which 18 are projects of the European Commission (FP7 and H2020).</p>\n<p>The Institute of Physics fosters close ties with related institutions across Europe and the rest of the world. Particularly notable is the cooperation with the European Organization for Nuclear Research – CERN. Moreover, the Institute’s strategic partners include Italy’s National Institute for Nuclear Research (INFN) and DESY, the largest scientific facility in Germany.</p>\n<p>Owing to its unique spirit, state-of-the-art research and fruitful innovations, the Institute of Physics is recognized today in Serbia as a leading national research institution, in the region as a center of excellence, and in Europe and globally as a trustworthy partner and a relevant research center.</p>","logo":"https://wiki.ni4os.eu/images/c/cc/IPB.png","multimedia":[{"multimediaURL":"https://youtu.be/1Gvk8Ru-E7E","multimediaName":"multimedia link"}],"scientificDomains":[{"scientificDomain":"scientific_domain-natural_sciences","scientificSubdomain":"scientific_subdomain-natural_sciences-physical_sciences"}],"tags":["institute","physics","belgrade"],"structureTypes":[],"location":{"streetNameAndNumber":"Pregrevica 118","postalCode":"11080","city":"Belgrade","region":null,"country":"RS"},"mainContact":null,"publicContacts":[{"firstName":"Dusan","lastName":"Vudragovic","email":"dusan@ipb.ac.rs","phone":"+38163699621","position":"Assistant Professor"}],"lifeCycleStatus":"provider_life_cycle_status-operational","certifications":[],"participatingCountries":[],"affiliations":[],"networks":[],"catalogueId":"ni4os","esfriDomains":[],"esfriType":null,"merilScientificDomains":[],"areasOfActivity":[],"societalGrandChallenges":[],"nationalRoadmaps":null,"users":null},{"id":"sks","abbreviation":"SKS","name":"Scientific Knowledge Services","website":"https://www.knowledge.services","legalEntity":true,"legalStatus":"provider_legal_status-private_company","hostingLegalEntity":null,"description":"We are a company which provides consultancy to research organisations and funders to make a mindful transition to Open Science (including Open Access) and to disseminate trustful knowledge between research groups and to society.

Veterinary supervision is available on a daily basis, and accreditation has already been obtained by the responsible European and National Committees.The Clinical Research infrastructure includes a 6-bed day clinic specialized in cardiovascular, metabolic, hematological and malignant diseases and is supported by the necessary medical personnel and infrastructure including a Positron Emission Tomography unit (PET-CT), echocardiography unit, cardiopulmonary exercise stress unit etc. It is notable that the Cord Blood Bank, which operates under the auspices of BRFAA, has made various contributions of stem cells, including several to the Children's University Hospital that were used successfully in transplantations for the treatment of cases of hematological malignancy cases Moreover, the Center for Environmental Health, which is linked to a satellite, monitors continuously climate changes (ozone levels, solar radiation and atmospheric pollutants).</span><br/><br/><span>Within its 10 years of full operation, the rigorous research performed at BRFAA is already receiving international recognition, as its investigators have published an impressive number of scientific publications in high-impact journals (~1100 publications). Moreover, BRFAA has also already achieved an excellent track record in attracting and managing research funding from Greek, European, US, and other sources. Although intramural bridging funding is distributed according to need and mainly on the basis of scientific merit, most of the scientific activities are supported by competitive grants provided by a number of funding agencies. Since its establishment, BRFAA has participated in a total of about 70 EU programs (ERC, FP6, FP7, Horizon 2020, Life Science priority and Marie Curie mobility projects), as well as programs from the European Economic Area (EEA). In addition to National and European grants, research at BRFAA is also funded by other International sources such as AICR, Leukemia and Lymphoma Society of America, Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, Parkinson’s Disease Foundation, Michael J. Fox Foundation, March of Dimes, NIH, Human Frontier Science Foundation, as well as from Pharmaceutical and Biotechnology industrial partners. The total annual budget of BRFAA exceeds 18 million Euros, of which support of approximately 2 million is coming from the Greek Government, 7 million from competitive research grants and the remaining from services and other sources.</span><br/><br/><span>It should be pointed out that the assortment of facilities has been recently complemented and enhanced by the development of the following infrastructures:</span><br/><br/><span>a) A Greek Biobank for the collection and storage of tissues, fluids and surgical specimens.

In 2012 CLARIN ERIC was established and took up the mission to create and maintain an infrastructure to support the sharing, use and sustainability of language data and tools for research in the humanities and social sciences. Currently CLARIN provides easy and sustainable access to digital language data (in written, spoken, or multimodal form) for scholars in the social sciences and humanities, and beyond. CLARIN also offers advanced tools to discover, explore, exploit, annotate, analyse or combine such data sets, wherever they are located. This is enabled through a networked federation of centres: language data repositories, service centres and knowledge centres, with single sign-on access for all members of the academic community in all participating countries. Tools and data from different centres are interoperable, so that data collections can be combined and tools from different sources can be chained to perform complex operations to support researchers in their work. The CLARIN infrastructure is fully operational in many countries, and a large number of participating centres are offering access services to data, tools and expertise. At the same time, CLARIN continues to be constructed in some countries that joined more recently, and CLARIN’s datasets and services are constantly updated and improved.

We are associated with our radar antennas, that are located in Kiruna, Sweden; Sodankyä, Finland; Tromsø, Norway and in Longyearbyen, Svalbard. In Tromsø we also have a combined ionospheric heating and short-wave radar facility. EISCAT was established in 1975. We are a scientific organisation that conducts research on the lower, middle and upper atmosphere and ionosphere using the incoherent scatter radar technique. This technique is the most powerful ground-based tool for these research applications. The first EISCAT system, the UHF incoherent scatter radar, became operable in 1981. Since then, the facilities of the EISCAT Scientific Association have been continuously developed and extended and today comprise world-class radars and a powerful ionospheric heating facility.\nEISCAT is also being used as a coherent scatter radar for studying instabilities in the ionosphere, as well as for investigating the structure and dynamics of the middle atmosphere and as a diagnostic instrument in ionospheric modification experiments with the Heating facility. There are ten incoherent scatter radars in the world, and we here at EISCAT operates three of the highest-standard facilities. These sites are located in the Scandinavian sector, north of the Arctic Circle.

TalTech’s mission is to be a promoter of science, technology, and innovation and a leading provider of engineering and economic education in Estonia.\nThe mission of Tallinn University of Tehnology is to be a leading provider of engineering and economics, as well as a leader in the fields of engineering sciences and smart technologies.\nOur slogan Mente et manu reflects the values of the university community, attaching equal importance to critical and creative thinking, entrepreneurial and practical actions as well as openness, reliability and cooperation.\nOn 17 September 1918, the Estonian Engineering Society opened an Estonian-based engineering school named Special Engineering Courses. That date has been recognised as the founding date of Tallinn University of Technology.[3] Programmes were offered in mechanical, electrical, civil and hydraulic engineering, shipbuilding and architecture. In 1919, the school became the private Tallinn College of Engineering, which in 1920 was declared a state institution. Teachers' efforts to develop an Estonian terminology for science and technology proved fruitful and the first engineering books were published. In 1923, the first engineering graduation theses were defended in Estonia. In the same year, a state laboratory of materials testing opened for research work.\nBy the 15 September 1936 Act of the Head of State, the school was granted university status, and named Tallinn Technical Institute. The institute had two faculties: civil and mechanical engineering and chemistry and mining. In 1938, the name Tallinn Technical University (Tallinna Tehnikaülikool, TTÜ in Estonian) was effective. In 1940 the Faculty of Economics, in 1958 the Faculty of Power Engineering and in 1965 the Faculty of Control Engineering were founded. After 2003 the university was known in English as Tallinn University of Technology (TUT).\nOver the next few decades degree programmes have expanded significantly, the student and research community has become increasingly international.","logo":"https://taltech.ee/static/taltech-logo-cutout.svg","multimedia":[],"scientificDomains":[],"tags":[],"structureTypes":[],"location":{"streetNameAndNumber":"Ehitajate tee 5","postalCode":"12616","city":"Tallinn","region":null,"country":"EE"},"mainContact":null,"publicContacts":[{"firstName":"Janelle","lastName":"Kirss","email":"data@taltech.ee","phone":null,"position":null}],"lifeCycleStatus":null,"certifications":[],"participatingCountries":[],"affiliations":[],"networks":[],"catalogueId":"eosc","esfriDomains":[],"esfriType":null,"merilScientificDomains":[],"areasOfActivity":[],"societalGrandChallenges":[],"nationalRoadmaps":[],"users":null},{"id":"lago","abbreviation":"LAGO","name":"Latin American Giant Observatory","website":"https://lagoproject.net/","legalEntity":false,"legalStatus":null,"hostingLegalEntity":"provider_hosting_legal_entity-ciemat","description":"The [Latin American Giant Observatory](http://lagoproject.net/) (LAGO) is an extended Astroparticle Observatory at global scale.

LifeWatch ERIC was established as a European Research Infrastructure Consortium by the European Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2017/499 of 17 March 2017. In setting up LifeWatch ERIC, the EC is seeking to address, by means of long term investment, the global factors (climate, demographic pressure, pollution, soil consumption, etc.) responsible for ongoing loss of biological diversity and ecosystem functioning, with direct impacts on the well-being and development of today's society. Understanding the evolution and functions of biodiversity and ecosystem services is now of crucial importance, not only for scientific reasons, but also to meet the demand from policy makers, managers and stakeholders for scientific-based tools. This requires analysis of both impacts and managerial decisions on a range of spatial and temporal scales; observation (and monitoring) of data from both ecosystems and laboratory experiments; and appropriate storage and management of relevant data. It also implies the setting of standards to ensure interoperability and accurate models of ecosystem dynamics. LifeWatch ERIC seeks to understand the complex interactions between species and the environment, taking advantage of High-Performance, Grid and Big Data computing systems, and the development of advanced modelling tools to implement management measures aimed at preserving life on Earth. Combining a wide range of ICT tools and resources with deep knowledge of the domain, LifeWatch ERIC's mission is to be a \"first class\" worldwide provider of content and services for the Biodiversity research community by: a) Offering new opportunities for large-scale scientific development , b) Enabling accelerated data capture with innovative new technologies, c) Supporting knowledge-based decision-making for biodiversity and ecosystem management, d) Providing training, dissemination and awareness programmes.","logo":"https://www.lifewatch.eu/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/LW_ERIC.png","multimedia":[{"multimediaURL":"https://www.lifewatch.eu/photo-video-gallery/","multimediaName":"LifeWatch ERIC - Photo & Video Gallery"}],"scientificDomains":[{"scientificDomain":"scientific_domain-natural_sciences","scientificSubdomain":"scientific_subdomain-natural_sciences-earth_and_related_environmental_sciences"},{"scientificDomain":"scientific_domain-natural_sciences","scientificSubdomain":"scientific_subdomain-natural_sciences-biological_sciences"},{"scientificDomain":"scientific_domain-natural_sciences","scientificSubdomain":"scientific_subdomain-natural_sciences-computer_and_information_sciences"},{"scientificDomain":"scientific_domain-engineering_and_technology","scientificSubdomain":"scientific_subdomain-engineering_and_technology-electrical_electronic_and_information_engineering"}],"tags":["e-Science research facilities","Biodiversity ","Ecosystem functions ","e-Infrastructures","FAIRness"],"structureTypes":["provider_structure_type-distributed"],"location":{"streetNameAndNumber":"Plaza España SN, SECTOR II-III","postalCode":"41013","city":"Seville","region":null,"country":"ES"},"mainContact":null,"publicContacts":[{"firstName":null,"lastName":null,"email":"communications@lifewatch.eu","phone":"","position":null}],"lifeCycleStatus":"provider_life_cycle_status-operational","certifications":[],"participatingCountries":["OT"],"affiliations":[],"networks":[],"catalogueId":"eosc","esfriDomains":["provider_esfri_domain-environment","provider_esfri_domain-data_computing_and_digital_research_infrastructures"],"esfriType":"provider_esfri_type-other","merilScientificDomains":[{"merilScientificDomain":"provider_meril_scientific_domain-earth_and_environmental_sciences","merilScientificSubdomain":"provider_meril_scientific_subdomain-earth_and_environmental_sciences-earth_ocean_marine_freshwater_and_atmosphere_data_centres"}],"areasOfActivity":["provider_area_of_activity-applied_research","provider_area_of_activity-basic_research","provider_area_of_activity-technological_development"],"societalGrandChallenges":["provider_societal_grand_challenge-environment"],"nationalRoadmaps":[],"users":null},{"id":"consorci_cee_lab_llum_sincrotro","abbreviation":"Alba Synchrotron Light facility","name":"CONSORCI PER  A LA CONSTRUCCIÓ, EQUIPAMENT I EXPLOTACIÓ DEL LABORATORI DE LLUM SINCROTRÓ","website":"http://www.cells.es","legalEntity":true,"legalStatus":"provider_legal_status-consortium","hostingLegalEntity":null,"description":"MISSION: To research, deliver and maintain methods and techniques with which to conduct cutting edge synchrotron light based research and development, in such a way that knowledge and added value data are pumped into the scientific and industrial communities, particularly those in Spain, with the ultimate goal of contributing to the improvement in the well-being and progress of society as a whole.\n\nVISION: To become a center of excellence for synchrotron light based scientific and industrial applications at a European level and to achieve the status of a recognized world-class facility.\n\nHISTORY: The ALBA Synchrotron project was approved in 2003 and funded in equal parts by the Spanish and the Catalonian Administration.\nFor that purpose, the Consortium for the Construction, Equipping and Exploitation of the Synchrotron Light Source (CELLS) is created to manage the ALBA Synchrotron.

The company provides the edge-to-cloud management platform Nuvla.io, which allows companies and institutions to deploy a secure and comprehensive edge and cloud strategy, while avoiding lock-in. Most of our software is open source. The NuvlaBox software turns any x86 or ARM hardware platform into a smart edge device. Think of NuvlaBox as the Linux or Windows of edge devices (in fact it is based on Linux). Nuvla.io also provides a Private App Store, with the same convenience as Apple’s App Store, but for deploying apps at the edge and in the cloud. As long as your app is containerised, you can deploy it with Nuvla.io, in a click! It’s as easy to use! We believe Nuvla.io will accelerate AI deployment at the edge and take away management complexity, while giving you full control over your data. Our customers use it to deploy retail, outpost, smart city, and science applications. What will you do with it? Let us know. Creating complex and sophisticated software like Nuvla and NuvlaBox and operating services like Nuvla.io is not trivial. We pour all our passion and energy in writing the best software possible. We hope you’ll have as much fun using our products and services as we have creating them. If you do, please tell us, and if we’re not meeting you’re expectations, we’d really appreciate you share your thoughts.","logo":"https://sixsq.com/img/logo/logo_sixsq.png","multimedia":[],"scientificDomains":[{"scientificDomain":"scientific_domain-generic","scientificSubdomain":"scientific_subdomain-generic-generic"}],"tags":[],"structureTypes":["provider_structure_type-other"],"location":{"streetNameAndNumber":"Route de Meyrin 267","postalCode":" 1217","city":"Meyrin, Geneva","region":null,"country":"CH"},"mainContact":null,"publicContacts":[{"firstName":null,"lastName":null,"email":"info+eosc@sixsq.com","phone":null,"position":null}],"lifeCycleStatus":"provider_life_cycle_status-other","certifications":[],"participatingCountries":["OT"],"affiliations":[],"networks":["provider_network-other"],"catalogueId":"eosc","esfriDomains":["provider_esfri_domain-other"],"esfriType":"provider_esfri_type-other","merilScientificDomains":[{"merilScientificDomain":"provider_meril_scientific_domain-other","merilScientificSubdomain":"provider_meril_scientific_subdomain-other-other"}],"areasOfActivity":["provider_area_of_activity-other"],"societalGrandChallenges":["provider_societal_grand_challenge-other"],"nationalRoadmaps":[],"users":null},{"id":"psi","abbreviation":"PSI","name":"Paul Scherrer Institute","website":"https://www.psi.ch/en","legalEntity":true,"legalStatus":"provider_legal_status-public_legal_entity","hostingLegalEntity":null,"description":"The Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) is the largest research institute for natural and engineering sciences in Switzerland, conducting cutting-edge research in three main fields: matter and materials, energy and the environment and human health.","logo":"https://www.psi.ch/themes/custom/design/psi.svg","multimedia":[],"scientificDomains":[],"tags":[],"structureTypes":[],"location":{"streetNameAndNumber":"Forschungsstrasse 111","postalCode":"5232","city":"Villigen PSI","region":null,"country":"CH"},"mainContact":null,"publicContacts":[{"firstName":null,"lastName":null,"email":"eosc-info@psi.ch","phone":null,"position":null}],"lifeCycleStatus":null,"certifications":[],"participatingCountries":[],"affiliations":[],"networks":[],"catalogueId":"eosc","esfriDomains":[],"esfriType":null,"merilScientificDomains":[],"areasOfActivity":[],"societalGrandChallenges":[],"nationalRoadmaps":[],"users":null},{"id":"suite5","abbreviation":"Suite5","name":"Suite5 Data Intelligence Solutions","website":"https://www.suite5.eu/","legalEntity":true,"legalStatus":"provider_legal_status-other","hostingLegalEntity":null,"description":"Suite5 is an Information Technology Solutions and Services SME with the mission to deliver innovative data-driven intelligence solutions through state-of-the art technologies.

For Europeans to understand this shared past, the endeavour must transcend national borders.\n\nTrans-national Holocaust research, commemoration and education is the mission of the European Holocaust Research Infrastructure (EHRI), and its main challenge is the wide dispersal of sources and expertise across many institutions. EHRI overcomes such fragmentation by connecting sources, institutions and people. The [EHRI Portal](https://portal.ehri-project.eu/) enables online access to information about Holocaust sources, no matter where they are located. The [Conny Kristel Fellowship](https://www.ehri-project.eu/Publications) gives researchers access to the resources of the world's twenty leading Holocaust archives. EHRI's extensive programme of networking and training brings people together. Last but not least, EHRI promotes innovative tools that advance the digital transformation of Holocaust research.\n\nAlthough EHRI’s primary impact is scientific, it also advances a wider social and political agenda. The recent rise of antisemitism, xenophobia and aggressive nationalisms demonstrate that Holocaust research is never a purely academic concern, but a prerequisite for open and non-discriminatory societies across Europe and beyond.","logo":"https://www.ehri-project.eu/sites/all/themes/zenehri/images/logo.png","multimedia":[{"multimediaURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQhqxPTP0s","multimediaName":"Multimedia 1"}],"scientificDomains":[],"tags":["Portal Holocaust Research Shoah Archives History Deportations Camps Ghettos"],"structureTypes":["provider_structure_type-distributed"],"location":{"streetNameAndNumber":"Herengracht 380","postalCode":"1016 CJ","city":"Amsterdam","region":null,"country":"NL"},"mainContact":null,"publicContacts":[{"firstName":null,"lastName":null,"email":"feedback@ehri-project.eu","phone":null,"position":null}],"lifeCycleStatus":"provider_life_cycle_status-operational","certifications":[],"participatingCountries":["EO"],"affiliations":[],"networks":[],"catalogueId":"eosc","esfriDomains":["provider_esfri_domain-data_computing_and_digital_research_infrastructures"],"esfriType":"provider_esfri_type-project","merilScientificDomains":[],"areasOfActivity":[],"societalGrandChallenges":[],"nationalRoadmaps":[],"users":null},{"id":"emphasis","abbreviation":"EMPHASIS","name":"European Infrastructure for Plant Phenotyping","website":"https://emphasis.plant-phenotyping.eu","legalEntity":false,"legalStatus":null,"hostingLegalEntity":"provider_hosting_legal_entity-jsc","description":"Sustainable intensification of crop production is a major challenge to ensure amount and quality of biomass for nutrition and industry.

The duration of courses leading, after the acquisition of 300 credit units to a Diploma, of Master’s level, is five years. The valuable work of NTUA and its international reputation are due to its well-organised educational andresearch system, the quality of its staff and students, and the adequacy of its technical infrastructure. NTUA graduates were pivotal to Greece’s pre-war development and to post-war reconstruction. The graduate engineers who staffed public and private technical services and companies were and remain by general consent, equal to their European counterparts. Many have been elected to distinguished teaching and research positions in well-known universities all over the world.\n\nUnder Article 16 of the Greek Constitution and consequent laws, and in accordance with its tradition and structure, the primary institutional component of the NTUA’s mission, effected through the integrated complex of studies and research, is to provide advanced higher education of outstanding quality in science andtechnology.\n\nFor this purpose, NTUA operates as a State University with nine Schools, self-administered by the Senate, the Rector, the Vice-Rectors, the School Presidents, representatives of the academic staff and students from every School, as well as representatives from other university bodies.\n\nThe obvious need for any major institute of higher education to operate and offer education and research opportunities within a well organised and completely unambiguous internal system of principles, aims, procedures, rights and obligations, led, between the years 1997 and 2000, to the in depth internal and external evaluation of the NTUA’s structure and activities and consequently to the drawing up, discussion with all NTUA’s members and approval by the Senate and the Ministryof Education, (Government Gazette 1098/B/05.09.2000), of the NTUA Statute. This code of operation and development, considered as one of the best European University Statutes, defines that the main strategy of NTUA in the new millennium, is not only to maintain its position as an outstanding and internationally recognised public university of science and technology, but also to strengthen that position as regarding all its basic operations.

Nearly 14,000 students are at the university, of whom over 1,300 are foreign students. The language of instruction in most curricula is Estonian, some more notable exceptions are taught in English, such as semiotics, applied measurement science, computer science, information technology law, and European Union – Russia studies. The historical buildings of the university are included in the European Heritage Label list as \"embodiment of the ideas of a university in the Age of Enlightenment\".

Its mission is to coordinate and federate resources in Europe to efficiently address the scholarly communication needs of European researchers in the field of SSH. OPERAS’ aim is to make Open Science a reality for research in the SSH and achieve a scholarly communication system where knowledge produced in the SSH benefits researchers, academics, students and more generally the whole society across Europe and worldwide, without barriers. The European landscape of scholarly communication in the SSH is currently patchy, fragmented and not organized enough to be efficient, particularly to address the challenge of transitioning to Open Science. This is due to several factors, such as the small size of resource providers, the historical underfunding and lack of sustainability in this area, the variety of technical skills and resources across the community. The nature of the SSH disciplines also adds specific challenges which are not correctly addressed at scale, such as the diversity of publication languages, the entrenchment in diverse cultural backgrounds and the need for specific forms of scholarly communication (monographs, critical editions, and edited bibliographies, amongst others). By fulfilling its mission, OPERAS provides the research community with the missing brick it needs to find, access, create, edit, disseminate and easily and efficiently validate SSH outputs across Europe. In one word, OPERAS unlocks scholarly communication resources and enables the whole field to reinvent itself in the new Open Science paradigm.","logo":"https://f.hypotheses.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/2465/files/2017/04/Logo-OPERAS-300x114.png","multimedia":[],"scientificDomains":[{"scientificDomain":"scientific_domain-humanities","scientificSubdomain":"scientific_subdomain-humanities-other_humanities"},{"scientificDomain":"scientific_domain-social_sciences","scientificSubdomain":"scientific_subdomain-social_sciences-other_social_sciences"}],"tags":["SSH","Social - Sciences","Humanities","Research - Infrastructure","Open - Science","Open - Access","Diamond","Scholarly - Communication","ESFRI"],"structureTypes":["provider_structure_type-other"],"location":{"streetNameAndNumber":"rue Coudenberg 70","postalCode":"1000","city":"Bruxelles","region":null,"country":"BE"},"mainContact":null,"publicContacts":[{"firstName":null,"lastName":null,"email":"info@operas.org","phone":null,"position":null}],"lifeCycleStatus":"provider_life_cycle_status-other","certifications":[],"participatingCountries":["OT"],"affiliations":[],"networks":["provider_network-other"],"catalogueId":"eosc","esfriDomains":["provider_esfri_domain-other"],"esfriType":"provider_esfri_type-other","merilScientificDomains":[{"merilScientificDomain":"provider_meril_scientific_domain-other","merilScientificSubdomain":"provider_meril_scientific_subdomain-other-other"}],"areasOfActivity":["provider_area_of_activity-other","provider_area_of_activity-applied_research"],"societalGrandChallenges":["provider_societal_grand_challenge-other"],"nationalRoadmaps":[],"users":null},{"id":"elixir-belgium","abbreviation":"ELIXIR Belgium","name":"ELIXIR Belgium","website":"https://www.elixir-belgium.org/","legalEntity":false,"legalStatus":"provider_legal_status-other","hostingLegalEntity":null,"description":"The Belgian node of ELIXIR brings together experience around data management, analyses workflows and data related trainings.

The university has approximately 27,700 students and employs around 6,000 people. Its faculties include (Lutheran) theology (with the Lutheran Church of Norway having been Norway's state church since 1536), law, medicine, humanities, mathematics, natural sciences, social sciences, dentistry, and education. The university's original neoclassical campus is located in the centre of Oslo; it is currently occupied by the Faculty of Law. Most of the university's other faculties are located at the newer Blindern campus in the suburban West End. The Faculty of Medicine is split between several university hospitals in the Oslo area. The university also includes some formally independent, affiliated institutes such as the Centre for International Climate and Environmental Research (CICERO), NKVTS and the Frisch Centre. The university was founded in 1811 and was modeled after the University of Copenhagen and the recently established University of Berlin. It was originally named for King Frederick VI of Denmark and Norway, and received its current name in 1939. The university is informally also known as Universitetet (\"the university\"), having been the only university in Norway, until 1946 and was commonly termed \"The Royal Frederick's\" (Det Kgl.

The Nobel Peace Prize was awarded in the university's Atrium, from 1947 to 1989 and will be so again in 2020, making it the only university in the world to be involved in awarding a Nobel Prize.[8] Since 2003, the Abel Prize is awarded in the Atrium.

It is an executive non-departmental public body of the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS). On its formation in 1954, the authority was responsible for the United Kingdom's entire nuclear programme, both civil and defence, as well as the policing of nuclear sites. It made pioneering developments in nuclear (fission) power, overseeing the development of nuclear technology and performing much scientific research. However, since the early 1970s its areas of work have been gradually reduced, with functions transferred to other government organisations as well as to the private sector. The authority now focuses on United Kingdom and European fusion power research programmes at Culham in Oxfordshire, including the world's most powerful fusion device, the Joint European Torus. The research aims to develop fusion power as a commercially viable, environmentally sound energy source for the future. United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority owns the Culham Science Centre and has a stake in the Harwell Campus, and is involved in the development of both sites as locations for science and innovation-based business. It has also been involved in undertaking safety and reliability assessments for outside bodies, due to its long running experience in such work within the nuclear field.","logo":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_Atomic_Energy_Authority#/media/File:UK_Atomic_Energy_Authority_logo.svg","multimedia":[],"scientificDomains":[{"scientificDomain":"scientific_domain-other","scientificSubdomain":"scientific_subdomain-other-other"}],"tags":[],"structureTypes":["provider_structure_type-other"],"location":{"streetNameAndNumber":"Culham Science Centre","postalCode":"OX14 3DB","city":"Abingdon","region":"Oxfordshire","country":"UK"},"mainContact":null,"publicContacts":[{"firstName":null,"lastName":null,"email":"foienquiries@ukaea.uk","phone":"","position":null}],"lifeCycleStatus":"provider_life_cycle_status-operational","certifications":[],"participatingCountries":["UK"],"affiliations":[],"networks":["provider_network-other"],"catalogueId":"eosc","esfriDomains":["provider_esfri_domain-other"],"esfriType":"provider_esfri_type-other","merilScientificDomains":[{"merilScientificDomain":"provider_meril_scientific_domain-other","merilScientificSubdomain":"provider_meril_scientific_subdomain-other-other"}],"areasOfActivity":["provider_area_of_activity-other"],"societalGrandChallenges":["provider_societal_grand_challenge-other"],"nationalRoadmaps":[],"users":null},{"id":"ccsd","abbreviation":"CCSD","name":"Center for direct scientific communication","website":"https://www.ccsd.cnrs.fr/en/home/","legalEntity":false,"legalStatus":null,"hostingLegalEntity":"provider_hosting_legal_entity-cnrs","description":"The Center for direct scientific communication (CCSD)\nworks for the researchers’communities and their institutional environment (research organizations, universities).

The specific goals are: a) Strongly support extensive sharing of scientific raw data to advance research in science and engineering, thereby also serving the prevention of scientific misconduct, b) Hosting raw data (also defining and maintaining metadata) and normalized data, such that data from different studies can be compared and used for other purposes than those initially intended, when the data were created, c) Building an infrastructure such that the big data are easily available by other computer centers and research labs in academia and industry, d) Make data ready for analysis by methods from artificial intelligence.","logo":"https://www.fair-di.eu/uploads/Logo/for_Web_Square_only/1_FAIR-DI_Square_S.png","multimedia":[],"scientificDomains":[{"scientificDomain":"scientific_domain-natural_sciences","scientificSubdomain":"scientific_subdomain-natural_sciences-chemical_sciences"},{"scientificDomain":"scientific_domain-natural_sciences","scientificSubdomain":"scientific_subdomain-natural_sciences-physical_sciences"},{"scientificDomain":"scientific_domain-engineering_and_technology","scientificSubdomain":"scientific_subdomain-engineering_and_technology-materials_engineering"}],"tags":["Data from basics sciences and engineering","Data infrastructure ","Material science","Engineering","Astronomy "],"structureTypes":["provider_structure_type-other"],"location":{"streetNameAndNumber":"Zum Großen Windkanal 6","postalCode":"12489","city":"Berlin","region":null,"country":"DE"},"mainContact":null,"publicContacts":[{"firstName":null,"lastName":null,"email":"info@fairdi.eu","phone":null,"position":null}],"lifeCycleStatus":"provider_life_cycle_status-other","certifications":[],"participatingCountries":["OT"],"affiliations":[],"networks":["provider_network-other"],"catalogueId":"eosc","esfriDomains":["provider_esfri_domain-other"],"esfriType":"provider_esfri_type-other","merilScientificDomains":[{"merilScientificDomain":"provider_meril_scientific_domain-other","merilScientificSubdomain":"provider_meril_scientific_subdomain-other-other"}],"areasOfActivity":["provider_area_of_activity-other"],"societalGrandChallenges":["provider_societal_grand_challenge-other"],"nationalRoadmaps":[],"users":null},{"id":"demo","abbreviation":"DEMO","name":"DEMO Foundation","website":"https://www.egi.eu","legalEntity":true,"legalStatus":"provider_legal_status-foundation","hostingLegalEntity":null,"description":"The EGI Federation is an international e-Infrastructure set up to provide advanced computing and data analytics services for research and innovation.

With the aim of filling this gap, ROR launched in January 2019. ROR is intended for use by the research community, for the purposes of increasing the use of organization identifiers in the community and enabling connections between organization records in various systems. Implementation of ROR IDs in scholarly infrastructure and metadata will enable more efficient discovery and tracking of research outputs across institutions and funding bodies.

Expert.ai mimics the human ability to think, reading, understanding, and learning from text in 14 languages. \n\nOur technology is based on state-of-the-art machine learning in NLP/U and a large, multi-lingual knowledge graph called Sensigrafo, which explicitly contains all types of linguistic information as well as general background knowledge and domain-specific knowledge. This hybrid approach enables expert.ai to cover a broad range of NLP/U tasks where understanding meaning is important, like text categorization, natural language inference, named entity recognition, question answering and question generation, semantic similarity and relatedness, search, and recommendation.\n\nExpert.ai has a large background in the application of NLP/U to the scientific domain as illustrated e.g. by our long-term collaboration with the European Space Agency (ESA), where we created a version of Sensigrafo specialized in Earth Sciences. Currently, such knowledge graph contains over 400.000 lemmas and 300.000 concepts interlinked via 61 relationship types that render close to 3 million links, including both general background and Earth Science-specific information. Expert.ai is also a partner in the Horizon 2020 project [Reliance](https://www.reliance-project.eu/), with the mission to leverage the wealth of knowledge in scientific documents and data, contributing to making them FAIR and assisting scientists through increasing automation. We also participate in strategic European initiatives in the field of language technologies, like the European Language Grid ([ELG](https://www.european-language-grid.eu/)) and the European Language Equality projects ([ELE](https://european-language-equality.eu/)).\n\nSome of expert.ai's applications in the scientific domain include: \n- Extracting information from scientific literature, like the main topics of a publication, fields of research, key phrases, and main claims.\n- Enriching scientific content (publications, datasets, software) with semantic metadata extracted from such content, enabling search and recommendation.\n- Assessing the level of innovation of a scientific publication, semantically comparing its content against the state of the art.\n- Supporting the comprehension of scientific documents by students and researchers by automatically generating quizzes with questions extracted from the text and evaluating their performance through question answering.\n- Automatically assessing research hypotheses by relating them with the state of the art.\n\nIn addition to our contributions to the scientific domain, key technical advances in other domains of social relevance include e.g. fake news and misinformation analysis and automated analysis of radicalizing content in social media.\n\nWe leverage our technical strength throug continuous research in areas of AI and NLP/U, with a track record of research projects publicly and privately funded and publications in top conferences in the field. For example, we recently published the book [A Practical Guide to Hybrid Natural Language Processing](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783030448295). Along with the book, we released the publicly available tutorial [Hybrid Techniques for Knowledge-based NLP](http://hybridnlp.expertsystemlab.com/tutorial/), which covers the foundations and practical applications of modern methods, techniques and models used for NLP/U, as well as their combination for exploiting large document corpora.

Apart from scientists widely regarded as among the world’s best, we are also positioned to take advantage of a pharmaceutical discovery program. At CNIO, our fundamental research is organized into different areas: basic research ( Molecular Oncology, and Structural Biology); patient-oriented translational research (Human Cancer Genetics and Clinical Research); and innovation (Biotechnology and Experimental Therapeutics).\n\nHere at the CNIO over 400 highly specialized professionals are working to defeat one of the main causes of death in our society. On a global level, we are ranked as one of the best centres specializing in cancer research, a claim that can be gauged by the number and quality of scientific papers accepted for publication in addition to the innovative breakthroughs that pave the way for new drugs and therapies to counter the disease. One of our main objectives is to arrive at an understanding of why cancer occurs in some people and not in others. We are absolutely convinced that only by understanding its whys and hows can we learn how to prevent it from occurring and, if that cannot be done, detect it and fight back when it appears.\n\nBy the same token, CNIO researchers make every effort to ensure that the benefits of their work reach the cancer patient without undue delay. We find compounds that seem likely candidates to be transformed into drugs and can be protected by patent and licensed out to the pharmaceutical industry. We take the lead in supervising clinical trials and do diagnosis and genetic consultation at the request of thousands of families. Moreover, the CNIO has given rise to new biotechnology ventures that create new jobs and also make direct contact with the patients. We have some of the most cutting-edge new technology at our disposal and our constant concern is how best to put it to use.\n\nWe are a young institution and a magnet for talented researchers from all over the world. Top drawer scientists and oncologists of the future come to learn at the Centre. Over 60%of our research associates are under age 40 and over 20% of the young people awarded post doctoral contracts come to us from universities outside Spain. It can hardly be emphaszied enough that the scientific advances that emerge from the CNIO are largely the work of women, who account for 68% of all scientists. That said, it should be noted that the percentage of women in charge of research projects is under 50%. Accordingly, in 2012 the Office of Women in Science (WISE) was established by the CNIO, aimed at countering the gendered stereotypes we see as the source of the inequality of opportunities between men and women, and from which scientific research is not exempt.\n\nFunding for our research is obtained competitively, rivalling with some of the world’s best and most prestigious institutions, as a guarantee of its quality.\n\nWe also partner with a number of hospitals and pharmaceutical companies. That close association not only enriches the excperiecne of our personnel but also creates an income stream that helps finance our research. Taken altogether, no less than 47% of the funding needed to carry out that research is obtained competitively. Of the remainder, 18% comes from, royalties, sales and licensing agreements with private sector entities. We remain strongly convinced that scsientific research is everybody’s business and so have set up the CNIO Friends programme (Come and join with us!) that is making it possible for us to carry out more and more research initiatives. That is why we are constantly organuising educational programmes and events, and from time to time, even artistic initiatives.\n\nScience is a big part of our common culture and so we want the CNIO to be a venue for stimulating people and ideas, together with an array of lectures and educational presentations, many of which are open to the public. The reason why is simple: a society that stays in contact with its culure, and so becomes more diverse, more egalitarian, is also a healthier society.\n\n\n","logo":"https://apps.cnio.es/app/img/header/cnio-stop-cancer.svg","multimedia":[],"scientificDomains":[{"scientificDomain":"scientific_domain-medical_and_health_sciences","scientificSubdomain":"scientific_subdomain-medical_and_health_sciences-health_sciences"}],"tags":["Cancer research","Molecular oncology","Structural Biology","Experimental therapeutics","Human cancer genetics","Cancer genomics","Bioinformatics"],"structureTypes":[],"location":{"streetNameAndNumber":"Melchor Fernández Almagro, 3","postalCode":"28029","city":"Madrid","region":"Madrid","country":"ES"},"mainContact":null,"publicContacts":[{"firstName":null,"lastName":null,"email":"bioinformatica@cnio.es","phone":null,"position":null}],"lifeCycleStatus":"provider_life_cycle_status-operational","certifications":[],"participatingCountries":[],"affiliations":[],"networks":["provider_network-elixir"],"catalogueId":"eosc","esfriDomains":[],"esfriType":null,"merilScientificDomains":[{"merilScientificDomain":"provider_meril_scientific_domain-biological_and_medical_sciences","merilScientificSubdomain":"provider_meril_scientific_subdomain-biological_and_medical_sciences-biological_biomedical_engineering_and_biotechnology_nanotechnology_research_facilities"},{"merilScientificDomain":"provider_meril_scientific_domain-biological_and_medical_sciences","merilScientificSubdomain":"provider_meril_scientific_subdomain-biological_and_medical_sciences-bioinformatics_facilities"},{"merilScientificDomain":"provider_meril_scientific_domain-biological_and_medical_sciences","merilScientificSubdomain":"provider_meril_scientific_subdomain-biological_and_medical_sciences-structural_biology_facilities"},{"merilScientificDomain":"provider_meril_scientific_domain-biological_and_medical_sciences","merilScientificSubdomain":"provider_meril_scientific_subdomain-biological_and_medical_sciences-genomic_transcriptomic_proteomics_and_metabolomics_facilities"},{"merilScientificDomain":"provider_meril_scientific_domain-biological_and_medical_sciences","merilScientificSubdomain":"provider_meril_scientific_subdomain-biological_and_medical_sciences-animal_facilities"},{"merilScientificDomain":"provider_meril_scientific_domain-biological_and_medical_sciences","merilScientificSubdomain":"provider_meril_scientific_subdomain-biological_and_medical_sciences-systems_biology_computational_biology_facilities"},{"merilScientificDomain":"provider_meril_scientific_domain-biological_and_medical_sciences","merilScientificSubdomain":"provider_meril_scientific_subdomain-biological_and_medical_sciences-biomedical_imaging_facilities"}],"areasOfActivity":["provider_area_of_activity-basic_research"],"societalGrandChallenges":["provider_societal_grand_challenge-wellbeing"],"nationalRoadmaps":[],"users":null},{"id":"blue-cloud","abbreviation":"Blue-Cloud","name":"Blue-Cloud - Piloting innovative services for Marine Research & the Blue Economy","website":"https://blue-cloud.org","legalEntity":false,"legalStatus":null,"hostingLegalEntity":"provider_hosting_legal_entity-trustits","description":"**Blue-Cloud** delivers a collaborative virtual environment ***to enhance FAIR and Open Science***.
