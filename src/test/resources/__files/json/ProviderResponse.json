      "description": "SITES (Swedish Infrastructure for Ecosystem Science) is a national infrastructure for terrestrial and limnological field research. SITES aims to promote high-quality research through long-term field measurements and field experiments, and by making data available. The core of SITES consists of nine field research stations that represent a variety of Swedish climate zones and ecosystems, including agricultural land, forests, wetlands, lakes and streams and alpine, glacial landscapes. The purpose of SITES is to offer researchers well-functioning infrastructures for field research. SITES also runs several long-term data collection programmes that provide researchers with contextual data. SITES is funded by the Swedish Research Council (VR), together with the principals of the research stations. The coordinator of SITES is the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU), where also the secretariat is located. SLU is accomplished by the principals University of Gothenburg, Uppsala University, Stockholm University and the Swedish Polar Research Secretariat. In addition, Lund University is partner of one of the long-term monitoring campaigns. \nThe collaboration is regulated by a consortium agreement between the principals. SITES is governed by an independent steering group and the daily work is led by a scientifically well merited director.\nA multitude of long-term data collection programmes is conducted within SITES. Data collected within SITES are freely available on the SITES Data Portal (https://data.fieldsites.se/portal/ - web link) and can be used by anyone as long as the data is cited and acknowledged, following the instructions in the SITES data policy (https://data.fieldsites.se/licence - web link). The SITES data portal contains quality-controlled data available for download, from all SITES stations and long-term monitoring programmes. New datasets are continuously being uploaded. Data that is still not published on the SITES Data Portal can be requested by contacting SITES (data@fieldsites.se).\n",

      "description": "The 'German Network for Bioinformatics Infrastructure – de.NBI' is a national, academic and non-profit infrastructure supported by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research providing bioinformatics services to users in life sciences research and biomedicine in Germany and Europe. The partners organize training events, courses and summer schools on tools, standards and compute services provided by de.NBI to assist researchers to more effectively exploit their data. In May 2013, the announcement of funding guidelines for a German Network for Bioinformatics Infrastructure (de.NBI) was published by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF). The aim of this announcement was to establish an infrastructure in Germany that will provide solutions to the ‘Big Data Problem’ in life science by means of bioinformatics services and training. A second announcement of funding guidelines for de.NBI partner projects was published in November 2015. The de.NBI program was launched by the BMBF in March 2015, and the partner projects started their work in November 2016. In addition, the ELIXIR Node in Germany is run by de.NBI since August 2016. Since November 2016, the de.NBI network consists of the eight interconnected centers including more than 40 research, service and infrastructure groups with about 150 bioinformaticians. In addition, it is possible to apply for an associated partnership within de.NBI.",

The central deliverable is an open source toolkit for multiscale VVUQ based on generic multiscale VV and UQ primitives known as VVUQ Toolkit (VECMAtk), to be released in stages over the lifetime of this project, fully tested and evaluated in emerging exascale environments, actively promoted over the lifetime of this project, and made widely available in European HPC centres and public, which is the service we provide to public via the EOSC portal.\n\n",

      "description": "The Centro Risonanze Magnetiche (CERM) is a center for research, knowledge transfer, and higher education of the University of Florence, located at the Polo Scientifico (Scientific Campus) in Sesto Fiorentino. CERM/CIRMMP is a research infrastructure for NMR in the Life Sciences supported by the European Community. The Consorzio Interuniversitario Risonanze Magnetiche di Metallo Proteine (CIRMMP) was founded in 1994 among the Universities of Florence, Siena and Bologna to develop and coordinate resources in the study of metalloproteins. CIRMMP manages and partially owns the instruments in CERM, one of the most well-equipped NMR laboratories in the world. CERM/CIRMMP hosts a number of laboratories, offices and common rooms over an area of 3,000 square meters. The flagship of the Center is the impressive collection of NMR spectrometers which feature the largest magnetic field range in the world (from 1.2 GHz to the earth field) and ranks it among the best equipped laboratories in the world. CERM/CIRMMP is located in the Scientific Campus (“Polo Scientifico”) of the University of Florence in Sesto Fiorentino, an area just west of the city of Florence. The campus borders Florence International Airport and yet is a mere 15 minutes from the centre of Florence, world-renowned cradle of renaissance art and culture. Its two-fold status as a public-private laboratory fosters interactions between private industry and public research institutions such as Universities, National Council of Research (CNR) Institutes and European counterparts, promoting synergistic activities such as collaborations and services to SMEs. CERM/CIRMMP is the Italian Instruct-ERIC Centre. Instruct-ERIC is the pan-European research infrastructure in structural biology, making high-end technologies and methods available to users. Instruct-ERIC became operational in 2012 and has grown through its R&D Pilot programme, to provide new services and training courses to support scientists. Instruct-ERIC will provide the stability and sustainability for Instruct services to the structural biology community and to the broader life sciences communities within Europe.",

Observatories are platforms equipped with multiple sensors, placed along the the water column and on the seafloor. They constantly measure different biogeochemical and physical parameters, that address natural hazards, climate change and marine ecosystems.\n\nEMSO offers data and services to a large and diverse group of users, from scientists and industries to institutions and policy makers. It is an extraordinary infrastructure to provide relevant information for defining environmental policies based on scientific data.\n\nEMSO is a consortium of partners sharing in a common strategic framework scientific facilities (data, instruments, computing and storage capacity). Formally it is a European Research Infrastructure Consortium (ERIC), legal framework created for pan-European large-scale research infrastructures.\n\nEMSO achieved the Certification of Compliance to ISO 9001:2015 standard for the “Design, coordination, and development of environmental research activities on seafloor and water-column”",

To perform its missions, the TGIR Huma-Num bases its activities on a innovative form of organization that combines human (collective consultation through Huma-Num’s consortia, which are groups of researchers and engineers, funded by Huma-Num, working on common areas of interest) and technological resources (sustainable digital services) on a national and European scale. With the consortia it supervises, Huma-Num coordinates the production of digital data while offering a variety of platforms and tools for the processing, conservation, dissemination and long-term preservation of digital research data. One of the scientific objective of such involvement is to promote data sharing so that other researchers, communities or disciplines, can reuse them, including from an interdisciplinary perspective and in different ways. More generally, the principles and methods of the Web of data (RDF, SPARQL, SKOS, OWL) on which Huma-Num’s services rely enable data to be documented or re-documented for various uses without confining them to inaccessible silos. As a consequence, Huma-Num encourages core principles and methods such as open science and the technologies of Web of data to promote interoperability as much internally to allow its services to communicate with one another, as externally to let users plug their tools into Huma-Num services. Technically, the infrastructure itself is hosted in a big data center in Lyon built by and for physicists. A long-term preservation facility from another data center (CINES) based in Montpellier is also used. In addition, a group of correspondents in the MSH (Maison des Sciences de l’Homme) network (http://www.msh-reseau.fr) all over France is in charge of relaying information about Huma-Num’s services and tools.",

It is the national university of Estonia, and the only classical university in the country, and also the biggest and most prestigious university in Estonia. It was founded under the name of Academia Gustaviana in 1632 by Baron Johan Skytte, the Governor- General (1629–1634) of Swedish Livonia, Ingria and Karelia, with the required ratification provided by his long-time friend and former student – from age 7 –, King Gustavus Adolphus, shortly before the king's death on 6 November in the Battle of Lützen (1632), during the Thirty Years' War (1618–1648). Nearly 14,000 students are at the university, of whom over 1,300 are foreign students. The language of instruction in most curricula is Estonian, some more notable exceptions are taught in English, such as semiotics, applied measurement science, computer science, information technology law, and European Union – Russia studies. The historical buildings of the university are included in the European Heritage Label list as \"embodiment of the ideas of a university in the Age of Enlightenment\". The university is a member of the Coimbra Group and the Utrecht Network.",

This data format includes metadata documenting the location, time and the evidence in support of the observation (e.g. multimedia or physical material in the form of a museum specimen or tissue sample). The GBIF data repository also accommodates checklists that provide taxonomic information about species.\n\nGBIF operates as a network which can be categorized into three tiers. \n\n1. GBIF “Data Publishers” are primarily responsible for data collection and processing and share QA/QC responsibility with other actors.  Many of these data publishers host their own data in institutional repositories, while others use domain specific repositories. \n\n2. GBIF national and organisational “Nodes” provide much of the quality assurance and quality control and many community-related services on behalf of data publishing institutions in their sphere, although the exact split in responsibility between Data Publishers and Nodes varies by country. \n\n3. The GBIF Secretariat manages the data architecture and operates a central registry infrastructure, data repository and index for the whole network. The Secretariat also takes the lead in enforcing standards and best practices for open data around licences, identifiers, citation, repository stability, etc. Where necessary, the Secretariat provides long-term data repository services on behalf of Data Publishers and Nodes lacking capacity for this.\n",

      "description": "In a similar spirit as that behind the building up and advancing the internet, it is now urgent to build a reliable infrastructure for data from basics sciences and engineering. This is being said since many years, e.g. at the launch of the NOMAD Laboratory in 2015 and here. And this is where the association FAIR-DI e.V. sets in: FAIR-DI will build a worldwide data infrastructure for big data from material science, engineering, and astronomy that follows the FAIR principles. FAIR stands for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Re-purposable/Reusable as suggested by Wilkinson and coworkers (Sci. Data 3, 160018, 2016). In the context of computational materials science, see also MRS Bulletin: NOMAD: 'The FAIR concept for big data-driven materials science'. The specific goals are: a) Strongly support extensive sharing of scientific raw data to advance research in science and engineering, thereby also serving the prevention of scientific misconduct, b) Hosting raw data (also defining and maintaining metadata) and normalized data, such that data from different studies can be compared and used for other purposes than those initially intended, when the data were created, c) Building an infrastructure such that the big data are easily available by other computer centers and research labs in academia and industry, d) Make data ready for analysis by methods from artificial intelligence.",

Content identifiers and contributor identifiers are foundational components of this network. But an additional component has been missing—until now, there has been no open, stakeholder-governed infrastructure for research organization identifiers and their associated metadata. With the aim of filling this gap, ROR launched in January 2019. ROR is intended for use by the research community, for the purposes of increasing the use of organization identifiers in the community and enabling connections between organization records in various systems. Implementation of ROR IDs in scholarly infrastructure and metadata will enable more efficient discovery and tracking of research outputs across institutions and funding bodies. ROR is run by a small group of steering organizations in collaboration with a broad network of community advisors and supporters.",

The identification service is updated monthly based on new data produced, shared and validated by the network of participants (i.e. users who have created an account and become members of the community). Pl@ntNet mainly concerns wild plants (i.e. propagating spontaneously in the natural environment) but also cultivated plants (of agronomic and horticultural interest). The visibility and use of this platform has accelerated since February 2013, after deployment on mobile devices (iOS in 2013, and Android in 2014). Since 2013, the number of daily users has doubled every year, reaching more than 400,000 users per day at some peaks in 2021.",

For more than ten years we have conducted applied research to scientifically support the long-term transition of the energy supply system towards renewable energy. Open source models developed here have firmly established themselves in energy system modelling. Our mobility and electrification concepts have been implemented by private companies as well as the public sector worldwide.\n\nWe are committed to the philosophy of our founder Reiner Lemoine. His vision was of a liveable future for all people, and with our work we aim to contribute to a successful energy transition. The energy transition shall be shaped and funded through the participation of all citizens and thus contribute to a fairer society. Our research results and findings are validated under real-world conditions wherever possible and made available to the public. We work self-critically, transparently, and are committed to scientific research ethics. In our research practice, participatory collaboration and a trustful and respectful work environment is important to us.\n\nWe are particularly pleased that in addition to our research we were able to create a positive work environment at the Reiner Lemoine Institute. We work together as equals on all hierarchical levels and many decisions are made collectively. We work for the energy transition with scientific methods – but also out of personal conviction. ",

At E-CAM we focus on four scientific areas of interest to computational scientists: a) Classical Molecular Dynamics, b) Electronic Structure, c) Quantum Dynamics, d) Meso- and Multi-Scale Modelling. We aim to: a) Develop software modules to be used in academia and industry to solve simulation and modelling problems. We will interface those software modules with standard codes and tune the outputs to run on the next generation of exascale computers. We will create an open-access E-CAM Software Repository containing robust applications, modules, scripts, and wrappers. We have set a target of 150 items in the repository by the end of the project. We will set software standards through best practice guidelines to ensure that appropriate documentation and metadata supports the use of the software, b) Provide information and opportunities for discussion on leading-edge simulation and modelling techniques. This includes workshops with industry to identify areas of mutual interest as well as the development of on-line training resources. We have strong industry links already with eight industry pilot projects underway from the start of the project, c) Train the next generation of computational scientists from both industry (new managers and computing specialists) and academia (post-graduates and postdocs). We want to ensure that there are continuing professional development opportunities for scientists and that our links with industry will provide career progression for the participants of our workshops.",

      "description": "EISCAT is an international scientific association with member institutes in several countries. We conduct ionospheric and atmospheric measurements with radars. As an example we can observe effects of the aurora borealis or the northern lights. We operate in three countries: Finland, Norway and Sweden, and all our facilities are located north of the Arctic circle. We are associated with our radar antennas, that are located in Kiruna, Sweden; Sodankyä, Finland; Tromsø, Norway and in Longyearbyen, Svalbard. In Tromsø we also have a combined ionospheric heating and short-wave radar facility. EISCAT was established in 1975. We are a scientific organisation that conducts research on the lower, middle and upper atmosphere and ionosphere using the incoherent scatter radar technique. This technique is the most powerful ground-based tool for these research applications. The first EISCAT system, the UHF incoherent scatter radar, became operable in 1981. Since then, the facilities of the EISCAT Scientific Association have been continuously developed and extended and today comprise world-class radars and a powerful ionospheric heating facility.\nEISCAT is also being used as a coherent scatter radar for studying instabilities in the ionosphere, as well as for investigating the structure and dynamics of the middle atmosphere and as a diagnostic instrument in ionospheric modification experiments with the Heating facility. There are ten incoherent scatter radars in the world, and we here at EISCAT operates three of the highest-standard facilities. These sites are located in the Scandinavian sector, north of the Arctic Circle. They consist of two independent radar systems under the auroral oval on the mainland, together with another radar in the north polar cap region on the island of Spitzbergen in the Svalbard archipelago.",

Allow citizens, educators, funders, civil servants and industry find ways to make science useful for themselves, their working environments, the society. OpenAIRE's mission is to shift scholarly communication towards openness and transparency and facilitate innovative ways to communicate and monitor research. OpenAIRE’s mission is closely linked to the mission of the European Commission: to provide unlimited, barrier free, open access to research outputs financed by public funding in Europe. OpenAIRE fulfils the EOSC vision substantially, as its operations already provide the glue for many of the user and research driven functionalities, whether these come from the long tail of science (repositories and local support) or domain disciplined research communities or Research Infrastructures. OpenAIRE is a participatory initiative from its onset. The current governance structure consists of three bodies: the General Assembly (decision making body), the Executive Board (steering) and the Management Office (daily activities). Our network of 34 European National Open Access Desks are experts in open access and open science. They are embedded in national infrastructures and settings voicing the needs of the research community. OpenAIRE operates a distributed management office with dedicated people that carry out the day to day activities, and provide the necessary leadership to coordinate the multiple facets of open science in Europe.",

      "description": "Vilnius University is the oldest university in the Baltic states, one of the oldest and most famous in Eastern Europe, preceded only by the universities of Prague, Kraków, Pécs, Budapest, Bratislava and Königsberg. Today it is the largest university in Lithuania. The university was founded in 1579 as the Jesuit Academy (College) of Vilnius by Grand Duke of Lithuania and King of Poland, Stephen Báthory. It was the third oldest university (after the Cracow Academy and the Albertina) in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. In the aftermath of the Third Partition of Poland (1795) and the November Uprising (1830–1831), the university was closed down and suspended its operation until 1919. In the aftermath of World War I the university saw failed attempts to restart it by Lithuania (December 1918) and invading Soviet forces (March 1919). It finally resumed operations as Stefan Batory University in Poland (August 1919), a period followed by another Soviet occupation in 1920, and the less than two-years of the Republic of Central Lithuania, incorporated into Poland in 1922. Following the Soviet invasion of Poland in September 1939, the university was briefly administered by the Lithuanian authorities (from October 1939), and then after Soviet annexation of Lithuania (June 1940), punctuated by a period of German occupation after German invasion of the Soviet Union (1941–1944), administrated as Vilnius State University by the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic. In 1945 the Polish community of students and scholars of Stefan Batory University was transferred to Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń. After Lithuania regained its independence in 1990, following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, it resumed its status as one of the prominent universities in Lithuania. The wide-ranging Vilnius University ensemble represents all major architectural styles that predominated in Lithuania: Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque and Classicism.",

It is a research infrastructure that was initiated from the vision that all digital language resources and tools from all over Europe and beyond are accessible through a single sign-on online environment for the support of researchers in the humanities and social sciences. In 2012 CLARIN ERIC was established and took up the mission to create and maintain an infrastructure to support the sharing, use and sustainability of language data and tools for research in the humanities and social sciences. Currently CLARIN provides easy and sustainable access to digital language data (in written, spoken, or multimodal form) for scholars in the social sciences and humanities, and beyond. CLARIN also offers advanced tools to discover, explore, exploit, annotate, analyse or combine such data sets, wherever they are located. This is enabled through a networked federation of centres: language data repositories, service centres and knowledge centres, with single sign-on access for all members of the academic community in all participating countries. Tools and data from different centres are interoperable, so that data collections can be combined and tools from different sources can be chained to perform complex operations to support researchers in their work. The CLARIN infrastructure is fully operational in many countries, and a large number of participating centres are offering access services to data, tools and expertise. At the same time, CLARIN continues to be constructed in some countries that joined more recently, and CLARIN’s datasets and services are constantly updated and improved. On the services page we show the services accessible at this moment and we explain how and by whom the various services can be accessed.",

      "description": "LifeWatch ERIC is a European Infrastructure Consortium providing e-Science research facilities to scientists seeking to increase our knowledge and deepen our understanding of Biodiversity organisation and Ecosystem functions and services in order to support civil society in addressing key planetary challenges. LifeWatch ERIC was established as a European Research Infrastructure Consortium by the European Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2017/499 of 17 March 2017. n setting up LifeWatch ERIC, the EC is seeking to address, by means of long term investment, the global factors (climate, demographic pressure, pollution, soil consumption, etc.) responsible for ongoing loss of biological diversity and ecosystem functioning, with direct impacts on the well-being and development of today's society. Understanding the evolution and functions of biodiversity and ecosystem services is now of crucial importance, not only for scientific reasons, but also to meet the demand from policy makers, managers and stakeholders for scientific-based tools. This requires analysis of both impacts and managerial decisions on a range of spatial and temporal scales; observation (and monitoring) of data from both ecosystems and laboratory experiments; and appropriate storage and management of relevant data. It also implies the setting of standards to ensure interoperability and accurate models of ecosystem dynamics. LifeWatch ERIC seeks to understand the complex interactions between species and the environment, taking advantage of High-Performance, Grid and Big Data computing systems, and the development of advanced modelling tools to implement management measures aimed at preserving life on Earth. Combining a wide range of ICT tools and resources with deep knowledge of the domain, LifeWatch ERIC's mission is to be a \"first class\" worldwide provider of content and services for the Biodiversity research community by: a) Offering new opportunities for large-scale scientific development , b) Enabling accelerated data capture with innovative new technologies, c) Supporting knowledge-based decision-making for biodiversity and ecosystem management, d) Providing training, dissemination and awareness programmes.",

      "description": "Expert.ai is focused in artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing and understanding (NLP/U), as well as their application to different domains, including space, science, publishing, pharma, telecommunications, finance, defense, and public administration. Expert.ai mimics the human ability to think, reading, understanding, and learning from text in 14 languages. \n\nOur technology is based on state-of-the-art machine learning in NLP/U and a large, multi-lingual knowledge graph called Sensigrafo, which explicitly contains all types of linguistic information as well as general background knowledge and domain-specific knowledge. This hybrid approach enables expert.ai to cover a broad range of NLP/U tasks where understanding meaning is important, like text categorization, natural language inference, named entity recognition, question answering and question generation, semantic similarity and relatedness, search, and recommendation.\n\nExpert.ai has a large background in the application of NLP/U to the scientific domain as illustrated e.g. by our long-term collaboration with the European Space Agency (ESA), where we created a version of Sensigrafo specialized in Earth Sciences. Currently, such knowledge graph contains over 400.000 lemmas and 300.000 concepts interlinked via 61 relationship types that render close to 3 million links, including both general background and Earth Science-specific information. Expert.ai is also a partner in the Horizon 2020 project [Reliance](https://www.reliance-project.eu/), with the mission to leverage the wealth of knowledge in scientific documents and data, contributing to making them FAIR and assisting scientists through increasing automation. We also participate in strategic European initiatives in the field of language technologies, like the European Language Grid ([ELG](https://www.european-language-grid.eu/)) and the European Language Equality projects ([ELE](https://european-language-equality.eu/)).\n\nSome of expert.ai's applications in the scientific domain include: \n- Extracting information from scientific literature, like the main topics of a publication, fields of research, key phrases, and main claims.\n- Enriching scientific content (publications, datasets, software) with semantic metadata extracted from such content, enabling search and recommendation.\n- Assessing the level of innovation of a scientific publication, semantically comparing its content against the state of the art.\n- Supporting the comprehension of scientific documents by students and researchers by automatically generating quizzes with questions extracted from the text and evaluating their performance through question answering.\n- Automatically assessing research hypotheses by relating them with the state of the art.\n\nIn addition to our contributions to the scientific domain, key technical advances in other domains of social relevance include e.g. fake news and misinformation analysis and automated analysis of radicalizing content in social media.\n\nWe leverage our technical strength throug continuous research in areas of AI and NLP/U, with a track record of research projects publicly and privately funded and publications in top conferences in the field. For example, we recently published the book [A Practical Guide to Hybrid Natural Language Processing](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783030448295). Along with the book, we released the publicly available tutorial [Hybrid Techniques for Knowledge-based NLP](http://hybridnlp.expertsystemlab.com/tutorial/), which covers the foundations and practical applications of modern methods, techniques and models used for NLP/U, as well as their combination for exploiting large document corpora.

These computing systems are used by scientists for a diverse range of purposes – from high-resolution simulations to the analysis of complex data.\nSimulation is considered the third pillar of science, alongside theory and experimentation, and scientists from an increasing number of disciplines are using high-performance computing simulation for their research. For example, supercomputers are used to model new materials with hitherto unknown properties. Climate modelling and weather forecasting would be impossible without them. In social science, simulations can help prevent mass panic by predicting people’s behavior. In medicine, computer simulations aid diagnostics help improve treatment methods. Moreover, they can facilitate risk assessments for natural hazards such as earthquakes and the tsunamis they might trigger.\nCSCS has a strong track record in supporting the processing, analysis and storage of scientific data, and is investing heavily in new tools and computing systems to support data science applications. For more than a decade, CSCS has been involved in the analysis of the many petabytes of data produced by scientific instruments such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. Supporting scientists in extracting knowledge from structured and unstructured data is a key priority for CSCS.\n",

      "description": "The University of Oslo, until 1939 named the Royal Frederick University, is the oldest university in Norway, located in the Norwegian capital of Oslo. Until 1 January 2016 it was the largest Norwegian institution of higher education in terms of size, now surpassed only by the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. The university has approximately 27,700 students and employs around 6,000 people. Its faculties include (Lutheran) theology (with the Lutheran Church of Norway having been Norway's state church since 1536), law, medicine, humanities, mathematics, natural sciences, social sciences, dentistry, and education. The university's original neoclassical campus is located in the centre of Oslo; it is currently occupied by the Faculty of Law. Most of the university's other faculties are located at the newer Blindern campus in the suburban West End. The Faculty of Medicine is split between several university hospitals in the Oslo area. The university also includes some formally independent, affiliated institutes such as the Centre for International Climate and Environmental Research (CICERO), NKVTS and the Frisch Centre. The university was founded in 1811 and was modeled after the University of Copenhagen and the recently established University of Berlin. It was originally named for King Frederick VI of Denmark and Norway, and received its current name in 1939. The university is informally also known as Universitetet (\"the university\"), having been the only university in Norway, until 1946 and was commonly termed \"The Royal Frederick's\" (Det Kgl. Frederiks), before the name change. The Nobel Peace Prize was awarded in the university's Atrium, from 1947 to 1989 and will be so again in 2020, making it the only university in the world to be involved in awarding a Nobel Prize.[8] Since 2003, the Abel Prize is awarded in the Atrium. Five researchers affiliated with the university have been Nobel laureates.",

The efforts of over 150 researchers and engineers, spread across the various laboratories within the federation, has led to the IPSL being recognized as a climate modeling centre of international repute contributing to the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change).\n\nThe IPSL data services, through the ESPRI unit, are in charge of system and network administration and the life-cycle of data from the IPSL Climate Modelling Center (CMC) and Centre for Earth Observation (CEO). They cover various fields such as data acquisition or production, data archiving and distribution and support of multidisciplinary projects carried out at IPSL. For 20 years now the IPSL data services organize the access for the IPSL laboratories and their partners, to different observational datasets as well numerical simulations into a central data repository infrastructure, easily accessible along with HPC computing facilities to make data analysis easier. The ESPRI service centralizes many different data products of interest for the earth-science community (satellite products, ground-based dataset, operational analyses and forecasts, climate model simulations). Thus, ESPRI engineers harmonize the development of a mutualized and multi-site data analysis platform and work in close relationship with scientific teams, allowing to understand and to take into account their requirements efficiently. To support the activities of data management, processing and dissemination, ESPRI has developed a national distributed IT infrastructure which combines massive, high-performance storage and computing resources.",

These bright beams are then directed off into laboratories known as ‘beamlines’. Here, scientists use the light to study a vast range of subject matter, from new medicines and treatments for disease to innovative engineering and cutting-edge technology.\n\nWhether it’s fragments of ancient paintings or unknown virus structures, at the synchrotron, scientists can study their samples using a machine that is 10,000 times more powerful than a traditional microscope.\n\nDiamond is one of the most advanced scientific facilities in the world, and its pioneering capabilities are helping to keep the UK at the forefront of scientific research.\n",

      "description": "The United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority is a UK government research organisation responsible for the development of nuclear fusion power. It is an executive non-departmental public body of the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS). On its formation in 1954, the authority was responsible for the United Kingdom's entire nuclear programme, both civil and defence, as well as the policing of nuclear sites. It made pioneering developments in nuclear (fission) power, overseeing the development of nuclear technology and performing much scientific research. However, since the early 1970s its areas of work have been gradually reduced, with functions transferred to other government organisations as well as to the private sector. The authority now focuses on United Kingdom and European fusion power research programmes at Culham in Oxfordshire, including the world's most powerful fusion device, the Joint European Torus. The research aims to develop fusion power as a commercially viable, environmentally sound energy source for the future. United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority owns the Culham Science Centre and has a stake in the Harwell Campus, and is involved in the development of both sites as locations for science and innovation-based business. It has also been involved in undertaking safety and reliability assessments for outside bodies, due to its long running experience in such work within the nuclear field.",

      "description": "Modern, democratic Europe developed out of the ashes of Auschwitz. It is therefore crucial that research into the Holocaust continues to progress. Only thus can our history's darkest chapter be reread and refined by new generations. For Europeans to understand this shared past, the endeavour must transcend national borders.\n\nTrans-national Holocaust research, commemoration and education is the mission of the European Holocaust Research Infrastructure (EHRI), and its main challenge is the wide dispersal of sources and expertise across many institutions. EHRI overcomes such fragmentation by connecting sources, institutions and people. The [EHRI Portal](https://portal.ehri-project.eu/) enables online access to information about Holocaust sources, no matter where they are located. The [Conny Kristel Fellowship](https://www.ehri-project.eu/Publications) gives researchers access to the resources of the world's twenty leading Holocaust archives. EHRI's extensive programme of networking and training brings people together. Last but not least, EHRI promotes innovative tools that advance the digital transformation of Holocaust research.\n\nAlthough EHRI’s primary impact is scientific, it also advances a wider social and political agenda. The recent rise of antisemitism, xenophobia and aggressive nationalisms demonstrate that Holocaust research is never a purely academic concern, but a prerequisite for open and non-discriminatory societies across Europe and beyond.",

      "description": "OPERAS is the Research Infrastructure supporting open scholarly communication in the social sciences and humanities (SSH) in the European Research Area. Its mission is to coordinate and federate resources in Europe to efficiently address the scholarly communication needs of European researchers in the field of SSH. OPERAS’ aim is to make Open Science a reality for research in the SSH and achieve a scholarly communication system where knowledge produced in the SSH benefits researchers, academics, students and more generally the whole society across Europe and worldwide, without barriers. The European landscape of scholarly communication in the SSH is currently patchy, fragmented and not organized enough to be efficient, particularly to address the challenge of transitioning to Open Science. This is due to several factors, such as the small size of resource providers, the historical underfunding and lack of sustainability in this area, the variety of technical skills and resources across the community. The nature of the SSH disciplines also adds specific challenges which are not correctly addressed at scale, such as the diversity of publication languages, the entrenchment in diverse cultural backgrounds and the need for specific forms of scholarly communication (monographs, critical editions, and edited bibliographies, amongst others). By fulfilling its mission, OPERAS provides the research community with the missing brick it needs to find, access, create, edit, disseminate and easily and efficiently validate SSH outputs across Europe. In one word, OPERAS unlocks scholarly communication resources and enables the whole field to reinvent itself in the new Open Science paradigm.",

      "description": "SixSq was founded in August 2007 by 3 partners. The company provides the edge-to-cloud management platform Nuvla.io, which allows companies and institutions to deploy a secure and comprehensive edge and cloud strategy, while avoiding lock-in. Most of our software is open source. The NuvlaBox software turns any x86 or ARM hardware platform into a smart edge device. Think of NuvlaBox as the Linux or Windows of edge devices (in fact it is based on Linux). Nuvla.io also provides a Private App Store, with the same convenience as Apple’s App Store, but for deploying apps at the edge and in the cloud. As long as your app is containerised, you can deploy it with Nuvla.io, in a click! It’s as easy to use! We believe Nuvla.io will accelerate AI deployment at the edge and take away management complexity, while giving you full control over your data. Our customers use it to deploy retail, outpost, smart city, and science applications. What will you do with it? Let us know. Creating complex and sophisticated software like Nuvla and NuvlaBox and operating services like Nuvla.io is not trivial. We pour all our passion and energy in writing the best software possible. We hope you’ll have as much fun using our products and services as we have creating them. If you do, please tell us, and if we’re not meeting you’re expectations, we’d really appreciate you share your thoughts.",

      "description": "The Spanish National Bioinformatics Institute (‘Instituto Nacional de Bioinformática’ in Spanish, or short INB) is the Spanish node of ELIXIR. The INB currently consists of 19 computational biology groups constituting, it was founded in 2003 following the decentralized model of nodes of the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (SIB), being the bioinformatics technology platform of the Carlos III Health Institute (‘Instituto de Salud Carlos III‘ or ISCIII) between 2018 and 2021. The INB has increased the participant nodes to 19 research groups distributed across 13 institutions in Spain. The two main overarching objectives are maintaining and increasing the alignment of the INB with ELIXIR (European Life Science Infrastructure for Biological Information) looking for deeper synergies, while increasing the translational capacity of the INB towards the Spanish National Health System (SNS). The INB serves in the coordination, integration and development of Spanish bioinformatics resources in projects in the areas of genomics, proteomics and translational medicine. It has contributed to the creation of a consistent computational infrastructure in the area of bioinformatics, participated in national and international genome projects, and trained bioinformatics users and developers.",

It conducts theoretical and experimental research in the fields of subnuclear, nuclear and astroparticle physics. All of the INFN’s research activities are undertaken within a framework of international competition, in close collaboration with Italian universities on the basis of solid academic partnerships spanning decades. Fundamental research in these areas requires the use of cutting-edge technology and instruments, developed by the INFN at its own laboratories and in collaboration with industries. Groups from the Universities of Rome, Padua, Turin, and Milan founded the INFN on 8thAugust 1951 to uphold and develop the scientific tradition established during the 1930s by Enrico Fermi and his school, with their theoretical and experimental research in nuclear physics. In the latter half of the 1950s the INFN designed and built the first Italian accelerator, the electron synchrotron developed in Frascati, where its first national laboratory was set up. During the same period, the INFN began to participate in research into the construction and use of ever-more powerful accelerators being conducted by CERN, the European Organisation for Nuclear Research, in Geneva. Today the INFN employs some 5,000 scientists whose work is recognised internationally not only for their contribution to various European laboratories, but also to numerous research centres worldwide.",

      "description": "Tallinn University of Technology (TalTech) is the only flagship in engineering and IT science and education in Estonia, providing higher education at all levels in engineering and technology, information technology, economics, science, and maritime. TalTech’s mission is to be a promoter of science, technology, and innovation and a leading provider of engineering and economic education in Estonia.\nThe mission of Tallinn University of Tehnology is to be a leading provider of engineering and economics, as well as a leader in the fields of engineering sciences and smart technologies.\nOur slogan Mente et manu reflects the values of the university community, attaching equal importance to critical and creative thinking, entrepreneurial and practical actions as well as openness, reliability and cooperation.\nOn 17 September 1918, the Estonian Engineering Society opened an Estonian-based engineering school named Special Engineering Courses. That date has been recognised as the founding date of Tallinn University of Technology.[3] Programmes were offered in mechanical, electrical, civil and hydraulic engineering, shipbuilding and architecture. In 1919, the school became the private Tallinn College of Engineering, which in 1920 was declared a state institution. Teachers' efforts to develop an Estonian terminology for science and technology proved fruitful and the first engineering books were published. In 1923, the first engineering graduation theses were defended in Estonia. In the same year, a state laboratory of materials testing opened for research work.\nBy the 15 September 1936 Act of the Head of State, the school was granted university status, and named Tallinn Technical Institute. The institute had two faculties: civil and mechanical engineering and chemistry and mining. In 1938, the name Tallinn Technical University (Tallinna Tehnikaülikool, TTÜ in Estonian) was effective. In 1940 the Faculty of Economics, in 1958 the Faculty of Power Engineering and in 1965 the Faculty of Control Engineering were founded. After 2003 the university was known in English as Tallinn University of Technology (TUT).\nOver the next few decades degree programmes have expanded significantly, the student and research community has become increasingly international.",
